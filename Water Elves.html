<a name='_b_Water_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Water Elves</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Region:</b> Azaili Empire<a href="" title="Create page: Azaili+Empire"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Anâá<a href="" title="Create page: An%C3%A2%C3%A1"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a><br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Blue skinned and blue haired, with slits for gills in their necks and webbed hands and feet, and the pointed ears of their race, the water elves are the oddest of alamia (type of elf). Their naked bodies covered only with seaweed and shells, the natural jewels of the ocean in their hair that sparkle like the stars. The Water Elves are the most mysterious of their race, few seen by humans or indeed even other alamia.<br />
<br />
There is no deviation in their looks, all water elves look alike, as they rarely mate with any other kind of elf. Those that do, do not reside with them, they are cast out has hybrids. Often a mixed elf that is part water elf is not born with gills so cannot live with their parents. These babies are taken to Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and given to the water elves there who raise them mostly on the land, but teach them of their dual heritage as a water elf.<br />
<br />
From the lightest hues of blue, to the darkest shades the skins of the water elves only vary in this way. Natural tattoos mark their skin according to their clan as is the Azaili physiology and a trait the water elves have inherited, it would seem. Those born near to the Dara Channel have their tattoos upon their faces and forearms, for instance. The markings are understood only by the water elves not even the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> know their meaning. It is believed that <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a> gave the water elves these markings, accepting them and protecting them.<br />
<br />
Blessed with lungs and gills, retractile webs between their fingers and toes (meaning they can have non webbed extremities when they are on land and amongst humans if they wish). Even when they are on land they rarely dress according to their land bound cousins. On Lenal they are more expressive of their elven nature, but outside of Elvenhome they might be considered somewhat feral, refusing to speak anything but their own unique languages or dress as humans do while on land. The Azail accept their natural whims, rooted in their elven nature. Water elves cover themselves with nature, with what the oceans provide.<br />
<br />
Their eyes glow in the depths of the waters only, an eerie sight if you have a ceranilli. Many an Adenian has been scared off by the sight of water elves in the oceans.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Very shy and rare they will only talk to <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> strangers. the fading is somewhat abated with the water elves as Elvenhome for them is all the waters of the Nether Realm. They can breath underwater and on land equally well. Because of this second sundering, this alamia do not even trust other elves. They have more faith and contact with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> then they do those on Lenal. Their mistrust can quickly turn to paranoia, and a water elf will often hit first, and ask questions later.<br />
<br />
They cannot stay in one place for too long as the call of the sea is often too great to resist. It has been known for water elves to walk on the land and have children and families with other alamia and even <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a>, but they will always inevitably return to the sea, leaving their half blooded children behind. Their first love is the water. It would take a near miracle for anything to come between them and their first love, their eternal love.<br />
<br />
Somewhat more feisty and devious then their Azaili cousins and more laid back then their elven brethren, the water elves often find themselves out of place when outside of the comfort of their clans. They are very close with their water elf brethren and will do anything to defend them, and will always take the word of a brother over anyone else's. Stubborn, hard headed and insular, the water elves are hard to befriend and not very trustworthy themselves. Their word is not their bond, as they will break it to honour the wishes of another water elf, even if it means breaking their word to someone else.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h2><b>History:</b></h2>
<br />
0E - The Making of the Elves<br />
<br />
- The Sundering of the Elves. Sub-races of elves were formed - these Alamia took on unique characteristics and traits depending on which part of nature they aligned themselves with. Some Alamia remain closer to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> than others, such as the Mountain and Forest elves whilst other such as the Ice elves segregated themselves completely from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
1E-The <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> curses the elves with the Fading; they are no longer truly immortal.<br />
<br />
17E- Second Sundering<br />
<br />
-Elves with an affinity with the waters of the Nether Realm congregate on the coasts of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Many of them disappear. When they return, they are changed; none would divulge what had happened to them, but it is believed they had merged with <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>.<br />
<br />
42E- The new Alamia - the water Elves - disappear, not to be seen on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> for another three thousand years.<br />
<br />
3042E- Water Elves return to Lenal and establish their own territories, mostly keeping to underwater caverns on the coasts of the continent and amongst the shoals.<br />
<br />
3043-Elehteon Tanarc and Ibalarorl Aguhrarn are chosen to travel to <a title="Vidonia" href='Vidonia.html' class='wiki'>Vidonia</a> to take their places on the Elven High Council as representatives of the Water Elves.<br />
<br />
3050E- Hope is given to the Elves; the High Council strives to understand how the Water Elves have not succumbed to the Fading after having been away from Elvenhome for so long. The Water Elves immunity remains a mystery, yet gives hope for the future.<br />
<br />
5576E- <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a>'s water kindred attacks the Water Elves in the Azaili Empire and almost annihilates them.

<br />
Water Elves live with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>, or by the shores near ports. They are very rare and are shy, curious creatures. Their origins are mysterious, yet some claim they are the descendants of an Azail-Elf? union millennia ago.<br />
