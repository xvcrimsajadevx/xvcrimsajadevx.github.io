<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b><br />
<br />
Because of the nature of this cult very little is known about its followers. Some believe that they sacrifice themselves to the Mountain Djinn by throwing themselves from the heights of the temple, but this is all conjecture. The reason such stories are told is because the members of the cult simple...disappear.<br />
