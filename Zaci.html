<br />
A strong looking older man, his beard is white with flecks of gold and his hair is long and tied in a braid that goes down his back. His robes are always sky blue and he rides what appears to be a dragon, but it is actually a Draconis, a dragon-like like creature from the Shadow Realm.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Zaci can summon other Eria to come to his aid without the need of another Quasi, he brings them to the Nether Realm though himself and gives his Quasi all the strength they need. He can call upon all the elements and wield them as he needs. He can stay for much longer then any other Eria as he is self sustaining. Some believe he has found a way to breach the Nether Realm without the Quasi, but he keeps his knowledge to himself as he thinks it will upset Balance. He rarely stay long due to this belief also.<br />
<br />
He speaks to Quasi in dreams and only the strongest summoners can call upon him. Those that prove their power and complete his trials are taught the secrets of the Shadow Realm and the longed for ability to reconnect with the Ether. Only one summoner other then Isdrae has ever achieved this feat.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Zaci is a reluctant summon, an Eria who only allows himself to come to the Nether Realm when he feels the others are abusing the Quasi. The father of all summons, his wrath is not something you would want to be on the end of.<br />
