<br />
<b>LIFESPAN:</b> As magic users they have an extended lifespan that matched wizards and sorcerers, but as they are untrained and do not know how to stop their appearance from looking older, they age normally until they are old, but are not frail.

They tend to grow their hair long, men and women, and the men grow their beards. There are some druids clans in which they raise their children, but most of the temple clans are child free and consisted of adults who have gone on a pilgrimage to find <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a>. These individuals come from varied backgrounds. Some will be brought up Druids, others will have discovered their powers to use magic and chose this strange religion as a way to channel their powers. Converts and several generations of Druids live together in harmony, serving <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> their only desire, creating a peaceful community.<br />

<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
The origins of the druids of <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> are debatable. Most believe that <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> himself drew a select few humans to him and taught them the ways of Nature. He taught them how to control the element of earth, how to speak to the tree spirits, work with the dryads to preserve the forests, and heal human flesh and that of plants and animals. Over the generations their link with <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> became stronger and those who dedicated their life to him acquired unusual powers. These were not powers they were born with, most outsiders believe they are taught magics only known by their god and that he blesses them with his knowledge.<br />
<br />
The Druids are only just starting to wane, their numbers dwindle. Their are only a very family clans belonging to the druids now and the temples are sparsely populated. They took refuge in the forests of Fenlar, but recently have lost many numbers to the bandits that have taken over the land. Omri has summoned his people to him, to his main temple on an island only druids know how to get to.<br />
<br />
<b>MAGIC:</b><br />
<br />
 The Druids of Omri are humans untrained as <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> or <a title="Sorcerers" href='Sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>Sorcerers</a>, and have their roots deep in nature magics. Their powers are similar to the races of Titan, the difference being they use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> to control this element. The danger here being the risk of becoming a <a title="Earth Magi" href='Earth+Magi.html' class='wiki'>Earth Magi</a>. They are taught specific spells by their 'god' <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a>, and use their magic to help and to worship their 'god', the Djinn of Nature<br />
<br />
<b>EXTRA INFO:</b><br />
<br />
The <a title="Earth Magi" href='Earth+Magi.html' class='wiki'>Earth Magi</a> mainly come from this group of humans. As they are the most proficient in earth magics, apart from the few wizards and sorcerers who specialize in geo-mancy, there is a higher risk of a druid losing control and being transformed into <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>. Those druids who are unlucky enough to have this fate are luckier then most wizards or sorcerers. <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> takes them in and teaches them. They become his most powerful followers, but because of the nature of earth and of <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> himself, they remain peaceful and in balance with the world, never using their powers and status as <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a> for evildoing.<br />
