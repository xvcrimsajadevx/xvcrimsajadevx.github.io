<br />
0E-Light creates Humans, Origins create Dragons, Azail, Elves and Dwarves<br />
<br />
- Nado and Tiamat created by Tempest. Tiamat lays many eggs. All dragons come from this King and Queen.<br />
<br />
-The Kindred Leaders are the first of Tiamat's eggs to hatch.<br />
<br />
1E-The Darkness curses the races of Light with Death. The Dragons, like the other races of the Origins, are protected by their origin, which in the Dragons case is Tempest. Their immortality is kept in tact, but they are cursed with infertility. This becomes known as the Dwindling.<br />
<br />
- Nado beseeches Tempest to protect the Realm of Nadozenith. The city itself, the mountain and the mountain range in northern Eramor become a Haven for all dragons. It is the home of Nado's first kindred, the Stormbreaker dragons.<br />
<br />
NOTE- No eggs were laid in the time between 1E and 3000E. The only new dragons came from Tiamats eggs which she laid BEFORE THE CURSE. Some of these eggs hatch centuries on, some even many millennia later.<br />
<br />
2E-War rages between the Light and the Darkness and a spark of neutrality comes into being. The Ether- a force of neutral power that exists in All Worlds and on all plains of existence. Strongest in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
- First Dwindling: Dragons who go outside of Nadozenith are attacked and killed. Many females die who travel with their kindreds outside of Nadozenith. The Kindred Leaders wait for the war to be decided before they go ahead with their plans to leave the great mountain.<br />
<br />
3E-The Djinn are born from the Ether. The Ether touches the Shadow Plane and the Eria are born.<br />
<br />
368E - The Kindred Leaders take their Kindreds from Nadozenith and establish Aeries all across the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
- Iryth settles his brood of Silvermyst Dragons in the Mountains of Salia, in the south of the Ice Continent.<br />
<br />
- Draeth has aeries all over the human continent of Avalon, but settles himself and a few of his dragons in the Mountains of Ceru (later, after the Great Cataclysm, they spread into the Mountains of Gallian).<br />
<br />
- Nado's second in command, DANUTH, does not venture far. He takes his kindred to the north of the eastern continent into the Umikabi Mountains, the largest mountain range in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
- Taiyth settles his Ananta Kindred on the northern isles (the Wizarding Isles)<br />
<br />
- Cheoseth goes west and his brood settle on Aether.<br />
<br />
- Lleseth takes to the waters of the Nether Realm and become the first dragons to swim.<br />
<br />
- The Cyclonia Kindred inhabit various isles in the Evadne Sea. Nothing is heard from them until Tiamat Rebels, as they join in her rebellion. Secretly they also evolve as swimmers.<br />
<br />
450E - Only on Nadozenith do females hatch from Tiamat's ancient eggs. Outside only drakes hatch.<br />
<br />
500E-The Light chooses three souls and imbues them with all of its power. These three are known as Light Bearers.<br />
<br />
500E-The Darkness twists 13 souls and makes the Thyrza. These 13 are the generals of the Minions of Darkness and their soul purpose is to hunt the Light Bearers and destroy them.<br />
<br />
- Tiamat secretly becomes a Thyrza. She breeds the first dragons since the beginning, her first new kindred being the SHADOWIND'S. They are hatched on the Dark Continent where Tiamat rules.<br />
<br />
- With the rise of the Thyrza come more attacks against the dragons. Thousands of Dragons from all Kindreds are killed by Minions of Darkness. Many of the survivors return to Nadozenith to stop the annihilation of their kindred's. Few females remain, as they seemed to be the main target. every Kindred Leader remains in his territories. Females are escorted by the Thunderdrakes to Nado for their safety and preservation, even though they are infertile Nado decree's that this must be (having been advised to by the Light Bearer, Orion.)<br />
<br />
510E - 80% of the eggs are stolen from Nadozentih. A great mourning commences. Nado suspects that Minions are amongst even his own children.<br />
<br />
550E-The Adair - Apprentices of the Thyrza- are added to the dark ranks. When the Thyrza are destroyed their apprentice replaces them. the Legion of Darkness fills All Worlds, waging a victorious war on all planes of existence. The Light Bearers flee to the Nether Realm, the last world of Light.<br />
<br />
560E- The Great Alliance between Humans, Dragons, Azail, Elves and Dwarves is formed to combat the spread of the Darkness over the Nether Realm and to help protect the Light Bearer's.<br />
<br />
700E- Tiamat Rebels :- The Dragon Queen tries to kill Nado and receives assistance from the Cyclonia Kindred from inside the Mountains. Outside, the dark kindred the Shadowinds (which Nado unsuspectingly sired) attack and wage a bloody battle upon the Stormbreaker Dragons of Nadozenith.<br />
<br />
Nado defeats her, his Stormbreaker's defeating most of the Cyclonia's. The Thunderdrake's come to his aid, as well as his second's Kindred, the Everpeaks. Between them they defeat the Shadowinds. Tiamat manages to escape.<br />
<br />
- Tiamat declares herself openly as a Thyzra.<br />
<br />
710E - As the only female dragon not cursed, Tiamat breeds even more Dark Kindreds. The VENOMWINGS, DARKFANGS, and the MALIA to name but a few. Many believe that this is the route of her rebellion. The Dwindling hit her the hardest and she turned to the Darkness so she could lay eggs once more. The worst of it is, to breed she must have turned to the Darkness secretly, then mated with Nado to create the first of these dark kindreds, the Shadowinds. It is believed this is exactly what she did. These later Kindreds came from the leader of the Cyclonia's, Jaceth, who she killed once she had mated so he could not raise a challenge to her.<br />
<br />
750E-The Triad (Tiamat, Hydra and Leviathan) is formed and wreak havoc across the Nether Realm. After a huge battle, where the Azail King Ahto and Queen Elektra are killed, the Triad are imprisoned. Tiamat has her wings removed by Nado and she is banished to the Oceans.<br />
<br />
- Only the Aquius Kindred are hereafter trusted by the Azail. The Azail cease dealings with Nado and every other Kindred. The Dragons are saddened by this, as the Azail were their closest allies in the Great Wars with the Darkness.<br />
<br />
800E- The Great Alliance is no more. The Azail leave, followed by the warring humans. The nations of Avalon cannot be allied with each other and bring nothing but chaos to the war against the Darkness.<br />
<br />
- The Emptying of the Skies. All Kindreds retreat to their territories. Few travel abroad and many humans believe good dragons do not exist any more. The Dark Kindreds attack any stray dragons forcing the Kindred's apart for over two thousand years.<br />
<br />
1000E- The Five Races live separately, only trading with one another, and fighting the war in their own lands and in their own way.<br />
<br />
1700E- The Thunderdrake's vanish from the mountains completely. They are hidden with the Winged Elves and none but Nado and the Elf High Council know of their existence. Even amongst dragons they are known as the 'amani', the Sacred One's.<br />
<br />
2300E- Aurora seeks refuge on Meru.<br />
<br />
3000E- The Birthing<br />
<br />
Orion visits Nadozenith and gives a diamond (known as Tempest, the Jewel of Orion) to the dragon King Nado. With the Dwindling claiming many females, now only 1% of the dragon population are female. With the coming of Orion for the first time in dragon history new eggs are laid. These eggs are laid by other females - the only one's until now belonging to Tiamat - and this era comes to be known as the Birthing. Nado asks Tempest to make the unhatched eggs in Nadozenith to be female. He sends these eggs to all the Kindreds all over the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
All the females who were gathered to Nadozenith at the behest of Orion over a millennia ago are able to have children. All these females remain on Nadozenith, and the new curse is not known for almost 150 years.<br />
<br />
-Orion goes missing.<br />
<br />
3100E - The Hatching<br />
<br />
The eggs Tempest blessed all hatch as females. All females are fertile. When these females come of age, around 3150E they mate with the kindreds and the first eggs are laid outside of Nadozenith.<br />
<br />
Disaster strikes and the dragons realise a new form of the curse exists. Only the Thunderdrake females who mated and birthed do not get sick. The Sickness strikes the young females from the Kindreds and they begin to die out. The Thunderdrake males and young females help those who have not yet died from the sickness and take them and their eggs to Nadozenith. Many females die, but some of the kindreds female are saved and rejuvenate on Nadozenith. Unfortunately these females are infertile now, but the eggs they bore that hatch as females are not. They are able to leave the mountain also, but their mothers must stay.<br />
<br />
-From this point all females who are not Stormbreaker or Thunderdrake must birth and hatch their eggs on Nadozenith to ensure the survival of their young. Those that do, DO NOT succumb to the sickness. Only male dragons who hatch from other kindreds outside survive. The female babies die within 20 years of hatching.<br />
<br />
- Males from all Kindreds come to Nadozenith to mate with Stormbreaker Females, or bring their own females to birth and hatch their eggs. Thunderdrake females leave their kindreds to breed around the Nether Realm and have cross kindred children, often returning to Gallian to be with their Kindred though.<br />
<br />
- Many dragons are birthed in Gallian over the next 2,000 years, the Thunderdrakes being very fertile. Apart from the few females who cross breed, Thunderdrake females are something of a myth, to see one in Avalon is EXTREMELY rare.<br />
<br />
4000E- Aurora leaves the Nether Realm through Orions Gate.<br />
<br />
4500E - The Summit<br />
<br />
As female Thunderdrakes are hunted, as well as those from other kindreds, by dark Minions, all the Kindred Leaders gather on Nadozenith with Nado. They decide that all females are to remain on Nadozenith, only a few to remain secretly in Avalon, in case Nadozenith is attacked and destroyed.<br />
<br />
4501E - The Gathering<br />
<br />
The Thunderdrakes once again step up, and escort all females from all Kindreds to Nadozenith. Nado sends Orion's jewel with the Thunderdrakes to protect them and their Kindred's females in Avalon.<br />
<br />
5000E- The Nexus causes a major earthquake in Avalon, the country of Gallian is no more. A mountain range replaces the fallen country. The Thunderdrakes mourn the loss of Gallian, themselves having survived the earthquake because they were in Yaenara and protected by Titan in Winged Elf City. The Blackwings populate the new mountain range, the Mountains of Gallian.<br />
<br />
5500- Tiamat escapes her Ocean Prison. The Azail hunt her.<br />
<br />
5700- The Weather Device of the Alatus is stolen.<br />
<br />
5710- Avalon is ravaged by extreme weather for 100 years.<br />
<br />
5810- The Wizards of Meru and the Quasi use the Ether and the Eria to maintain balance of the weather.<br />
<br />
5900- The Winged Elves and the Thunderdrakes are attacked by Obsidian Elves and Shadowinds. Almost every elf and Dragon are killed. Help comes from the other kindreds and the elves too late, and it is told to the world that Yaenara is destroyed and all have died. In truth (a truth only Nado and of course the Elf High Council know) not all died. At Nado's request, five female Thunderdrakes remain along with twenty males, and around fifty winged elves. They hide in the ruined city and their home is enchanted by Tempest and Titan. The Sanctuary of Titan and the Jewel of Orion hide the true city from everyone except the Winged alamia and the Thunderdrakes. Nado tells his Kindred Leaders this important truth, but the rest of the world believes Yaenara as dead as Gallian.<br />
<br />
- The rest of the surviving Thunderdrake males mix with the other kindreds. The females return to Nadozenith, a few going with their mates into the world. In Yaenara the five females are blessed at their birthing. Many eggs are laid, which hatch faster then normal, within 20 years. These new dragons populate the ruined city with the Winged Elves and the children they bare.<br />
