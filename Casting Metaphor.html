<br />
All <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> users are individuals and as individuals they have differences. This includes their strength in the Ether. In order to explain these variations and how they apply to learning Ether <a title="Majick" href='Majick.html' class='wiki'>Majick</a> I am going to use a metaphor.<br />
<br />
The symbols in this metaphor are:<br />
<br />
<div class="simplebox"><div align="center">Water - Amount of Ability</div><br />
<br />
<div align="center">Drinking Glass - School</div></div><br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Application_b_'></a><h1><b>Application</b></h1>
<br />
Each caster has on average one pint of water, which is their ability in using the Ether.<br />
<br />
Each school (of the <a title="Seven Schools of Wizardry" href='Seven+Schools+of+Wizardry.html' class='wiki'>Seven Schools of Wizardry</a>)is represented by a glass, each glass marked at intervals with spells. In order for someone to learn spells in that school they have to fill the glass with their water. (Once filled, or once a spell is learned, it is almost impossible to unlearn and then go on to learn spells from another school. Switching schools once mastered is extremely rare, but not impossible. This is more common when <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> become <a title="Sorcerers" href='Sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>Sorcerers</a> or switching between schools of sorcery.)<br />
<br />
Each school has a maximum volume, those who master that school (learn the most powerful spells) fill the glass with their water.<br />
<br />
Each glass for each school has a maximum volume.<br />
<br />
<ul><li> Divination and Healing = 1 1/2 pints
</li><li> Alchemy = 1 pint
</li><li> Invokation = 1 1/4 pints
</li><li> Illusion = 1/2 pint
</li><li> Enchantment and Charm = 1 pint
</li><li> Conjuration = 1 pint
</li><li> Abjuration and Alteration = 1 pint
</li></ul>
<br />
The corresponding <a title="Seven Schools of Sorcery" href='Seven+Schools+of+Sorcery.html' class='wiki'>Seven Schools of Sorcery</a> have the same volume.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Limitations_b_'></a><h1><b>Limitations</b></h1>
<br />
Very few casters have more than a pint of water (ability); therefore few master more than one school. It is possible to have 3 pints of ability and master Alchemy, Enchantment and Charm and Conjuration, but this is rare and such characters are very powerful and most likely not accepted unless the member is well know to us (IE: we are sure they won't power play). Similarly, a caster could have 1/4 pint of ability and only be able to learn the most basic of spells.<br />
<br />
As so few wizards have the ability to train in Divination and Healing (so few Sorcerers, Necromancy) they rarely learn any other spells from any other schools. Thus far there is no wizard that has mastered resurrection who can cast spells from any school but Divination and Healing.<br />
<br />
Ability AND the Circle AND the Leaders/Grand Masters of Schools limit learning in multiple disciplines. Some casters do not have the ability (to spread their water between several glasses and fill them up), some are forbidden by the Circle/Council (authority of their spell casting kind) and some Leaders/Grand Masters refuse certain students/casters to be taught in their schools (especially if they already master a school). The most powerful spells are secrets of the leader's and the schools and there is a binding spell upon the members of that school. This stops them from teaching the schools secret to anyone not ordained or without permission to learn. This is a feature of Wizardry and Sorcery and what sets them aside from other Ether users. Their arrogance and belief that their way of casting is superior is what these rules reflect.<br />
<br />
Those with ability (water) left once they have mastered a school mostly learn minor spells from other disciplines, if they have permission. Minor spells are often allowed to be learnt, its the more powerful ones that are often refused permission.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Elemental_Casting_b_'></a><h1><b>Elemental Casting</b></h1>
<br />
Those with Talents in Elements (pyromancy etc) often neglect their chosen school of training once they start to develop their elemental powers. Elemental Talents do not stop an individual from Mastering a School, indeed there are pyromancers who are masters of Invokation for instance, but these Talents do make it harder as the elements make it harder to focus and they tend to consume, such is the fear of Magi for this reason. Few ever manage to split their attention and learning as the element tends to take over all aspects and desires with Majick.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Invokation_Specifics_b_'></a><h1><b>Invokation Specifics</b></h1>
<br />
Time majick is not taught to everyone even if they have the ability to Master Invokation. These spells are fiercely protected and secret even from those within the school. Arcemedes takes an active part in saying who is and isn't allowed to be taught these majicks and has refused many who have the ability in the past. Seers teach these spells, but one does not have to be a Seer (have the Seership Talent) in order to learn Time Majicks. All Seers are taught Time Majicks though.<br />
<br />
Some who have been refused will create their own time spells (some ending in disaster as time is not something to be experimented with), and some often turn to sorcery who will teach anyone their time majicks.<br />
