<a name='_b_Tempest_b_'></a><h1><b>Tempest</b></h1>
<br />
Tempest is the Origin, or Goddess, of the Air and creator of the Race of Dragons.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
Tempest is the wind, the clouds and the rain. She can appear as a beautiful maiden, or an ethereal spirit, shrouded in mist with a crown of raindrops and two small suns for eyes. Her voice is the whispering wind and the roaring thunder, her wrath the hurricane winds and the lightning bolts...<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Tempest awakened with the first Light, blinded by the new born stars. The space between the worlds fascinated her, and saddened her. She wanted to be with the stars and shroud the new formed lands with her love. And so, she wrought her power and created the blue skies, and covered the worlds in clouds. Upset that she could not reach the stars, so far from her, she wept and her tears became the first rains. She toughed the land with her lightning fingers and whispered her love for the Light on the Winds. Shading Creation from the harsh heat of Pyra's golden spheres she wove air and light and made the clouds.<br />
<br />
On the highest peaks of Titans mountains she hovered, looking over Creation, and felt alone. She was alone in the skies, the worlds were empty of life. So she was the first to make life. She drew from the air and formed Nado from it, giving him solid form, and wings, wings so he could fly with her in the heavens! He was part of her and roamed the skies watching the other races birth. But he was lonely, even the companionship of Tempest could not stop his longing for another of his kind, so Tempest made him a female, and called her Tiamat, daughter of Tempest and Mother of all dragons.<br />
<br />
When the darkness cursed her children Tempest wept, great storms raged but Tempest still wept, flooding the lands with her tears.<br />
<br />
For millennia she was nothing but the wind, being tossed to and fro, watching her children die, lost forever to the darkness. When Orion sung to her, calling her down from her clouds, she stopped crying. She promised to come when her child called and sealed her promise into the diamond that bore her name. Whoa to those that stand against her in the End, for the wrath of Tempest will rage until all that threaten her children is no more... when the Light is safe and the Darkness sealed. Only then will she stop to weep for them...<br />

<br />
Tempest's powers can only be used by her races. Each spells strength depends upon the ability and knowledge of the caster. When the spells can be cast depends on whether or not the sky is visible when doing weather spells, or how much air is is a room if the caster is confined (the smaller the room, the less likely they are to be able to shatter a door with blasts of air). To generate air and wind is only for the most powerful casters. I.e one cannot cast the Wrath of Tempest if one is in an underground cavern. How these spells are cast also varies depending on the race of the caster. An Alatus may control the wind differently to a Dragon, and visa versa.<br />
