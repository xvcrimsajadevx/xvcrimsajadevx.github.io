<br />
Nenet manifests herself as a water creature. Similar to the Sirens, she is beautiful. She can appear as a Siren or a Water Magi (composite of water with a humanoid shape and features). always appears naked whatever her from.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
She has complete mastery of all water majicks, and like Naolin has complete affinity with her element and wields all the hydromantic majicks any wizard or sorcerer can, but she produces more water, and her spells are at least ten times as powerful as any wizard. Only the Water Magi can equal her, and her limitations in this world means she cannot stay around long enough to fight as the Quasi can rarely sustain her for long. The more powerful the spells she uses the shorter her duration in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
When summoned she can control the oceans and any body of water nearby.<br />
