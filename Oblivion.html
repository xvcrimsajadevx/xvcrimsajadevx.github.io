<br />
Pathways of the dead... this is the world of the dead, where the dead are imprisoned and their souls wander in darkness. Every human soul is lost here. Only human souls dwell in Oblivion, because of the Curse they are doomed to wander Oblivion for eternity.<br />
<br />
Necromancers breach this realm by astral projecting and rip these souls from it to reanimate the dead. The souls are corrupted by their dark majick though and are tainted until they can be healed and restored to Oblivion by a wizard or another capable majick user.<br />
<br />
<a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a>, particularly Divinators, draw these souls from the paths of the dead in Oblivion back into their dead bodies and heal the body the moment the soul touches it. This is better known as resurrection and can only be done by the most powerful of wizards. Some believe that the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Ezia" href='Ezia.html' class='wiki'>Ezia</a> was the first to learn this feat and teach it to the wizards. The soul must be returned to the body within two days or resurrection is almost impossible. Some say that there are only three wizards in the world who can heal a long dead body, and only seven who can perform the resurrection spell at all.<br />
