<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance:</b></h1>
<br />
Pyra has been known to be the origin to appear in race form most often. He finds his fire form to dangerous to travel in. Usually a very dark dwarf with bright red hair. He also has been known to appear as things on fire; bushes, rocks, and all kinds of other odd things.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History:</b></h1>
<br />
 Pyra found himself brought into being by the Light, and was surprised at the lack of anything but light and darkness. He struggled to find a place for himself, looking and searching for anything.<br />
<br />
His first attempt to aid the light was to create a fiery creature to light All Worlds. The darkness still advanced, so he created another. That one was swallowed as well. Fire after fire he created in the sky and still the darkness claimed them. Finally, using all he had left, he made the three largest fires, Utinu, Tinu, and Morwen.<br />
<br />
The three turned and began to repel the darkness. The battle went back and forth until the three began to advance against the darkness. Morwen advanced faster, attempting to rescue the others who had fallen. As she left the protection of her sister and brother, the darkness claimed her. She can now be seen chained in the darkness with all the lesser fires at night.<br />
<br />
Tinu tried to do the same, but her brother stayed close. They now chase the darkness across the sky until they tire and rest.<br />
<br />
After his final creation, Pyra retired to the centre of All Worlds to rest.<br />
Even as he slept, he created more fire, lighting even the rocks on fire and melting them. This fire tried to escape to join the other fire in the sky, but Pyra awoke and kept it all in the centre of All Worlds. Even to this day, it tries to find its way out.<br />
<br />
After his rest, Pyra tried his hand at better creations, one's that could fight the darkness off better. He looked All Words over, seeing what the other Origins had created, and taking from his power, he created the Dwarves.<br />
<br />
He proceeded to mould other creatures, the Phoenix to protect his first children, Magmas to help contain the Earth Fire, and an attempt to copy Tempest's dragons, though it failed miserably.<br />
<br />
When the darkness levelled it's curse with the creation of humans, Pyra did his best to protect his children, but there was little he could do. He pulled back to the centre of All Worlds to rest and mourn his loss. He would have to watch his children die. There he waits until he is needed to battle the Darkness again, lending his power to those who call on him.<br />

<br />
Pyra's powers can only be used by his races. Each spells strength depends upon the ability and knowledge of the caster. When the spells can be cast depends on whether or not the caster has the energy to spark the flame of Pyra. To make fire appear out of seemingly thin air is possible for the strongest of casters. Only the most powerful casters can do this as it requires great power and energy. Fire is the only element that is not a physical aspect so to speak. The power to create frie requires the ability to connect with Pyra, oxygen to burn and fuel. The spark comes from the caster and the stronger the caster the more easily the spark ignites the fuel and burns the air.<br />
<br />
How these spells are cast also varies depending on the race of the caster. A Dwarf may control water differently to a Magma, and visa versa.<br />
