<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
She looks like a young woman at first glance. Her eyes glow with a white light, its impossible for human eyes to look into them. Those that do get a look deep into her eyes will see the universes within them, with swirling galaxies and millions of stars. She has white hair and ivory skin, and always wears silver robes. Upon her head is a diadem of stars...<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
Her main temple is in Teran A'ao. A red stone edifice, a monument in the sand, surrounded by dunes and quick sand pits, its exterior has been worn away but the sand storms. It is never in the same place, always shifting through the desert, and is constantly surrounded by tornadoes of sand. Once you get inside the temple it is full of booby traps and pitfalls. Few ever reach the inner sanctum alive.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
She sees all, the past, present and future. Legend says that Eleph can travel through time, and through All Worlds and sees every alternate reality. These realities are the possible futures of worlds, and she uses them to see the future of the Nether Realm. Her prophecies are hard to interpret. It is believed if you look into her eyes, you can see your entire future. Many do not survive this, and few can see it. Only the universes can be seen, swirling in her glowing eyes, white specks of light and dark voids of space...eternity is seen through her eyes, and is in her eyes...<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Eleph is linked to the Oracles, although it is not known whether she created them or is their leader only.<br />
<br />
She is the Oracle of all Oracles, but to reach her is too hard for most. Her temple is located on the higest mountain of Avalon, and inside are death traps and mazes. Destiny and knowledge are hard to come by for everyone.<br />
