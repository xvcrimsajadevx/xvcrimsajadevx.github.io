<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
Sedana is a country with strict laws, and an efficient structure. the hungry are fed, war is rare as the army guards its borders rigorously. It is a thriving country and the most stable politically and economically in Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Each city has a purpose. Lorad is the fort in the wild lands, the less populated parts of the Country, near the borders of Sedana. Taborizz is the trade centre, where merchants gather and deal. Antaa is a port city and the political hub. Many pilgrims seeking Zadoks temple include this city in their pilgrimage as the priests of <a title="Zadok" href='Zadok.html' class='wiki'>Zadok</a> and aristocracy of Sedana congregate here.<br />
<br />
The villages are the same rigid culture, a smaller, simpler version of the cities. Sedana is Romanesque in the way they are religious and in their architecture... The style of a Roman temple mixed with a medieval feel culturally and style of technology. The outer villages are more relaxed but still have the heavy influence and a stricter way of life that the cities possess. They may rarely see a priest of <a title="Zadok" href='Zadok.html' class='wiki'>Zadok</a> but their fear of their zealous rulers promotes a subservient population, wherever you are in Sedana.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_How_does_their_society_work_b_'></a><h2><b>How does their society work?</b></h2>
<br />
Sedana is essentially split into two parts - 1) The political core and 2) The lower noble houses and the common people.<br />
<br />
The political core is made up of:<br />
<br />
<br />
The aristocracy<br />
The Watchers<br />
The senior officers of the Sedanian army<br />
The Priests of Zadok<br />
The Paladins of Zadok<br />
The private Council of the Sovereign<br />
The Sovereign<br />
<br />
The lower nobles and common people are very much left to live out their lives by the rule of this political core, these upper echelons. The lower nobles play their games and contest their own court in Edana, yet they are not oppressive at all, but rather support and help to maintain a balance of the standard of living with the common people - so much so that the term &quot;common people&quot; is not widely used at all. It is because of the lower nobles and common people that Sedana has become so self sufficient in many ways and so the upper echelons allow many freedoms to exist and traditions to be observed. The common people work the fields and the fishing boats, the clothing houses and the butchers, whilst the lower nobles are often lawyers and doctors. Their is harmony, and it is maintained by the Guard of Sedana - a separate force from the army that enforces law.<br />
<br />
The upper echelons preside over the land of Sedana and its running. They live not above, but almost to the side of the lower nobles and common people; although there are no places where they are not allowed to mix with the &quot;other side&quot; (a polite term used by aristocrats mainly), it often occurs that most people enjoy the company of those who are not on the other side and vice versa. The difference in wealth is sometimes obvious, but the other side are not poor - for example, no-one....absolutely no-one lives homeless or starved. The upper echelons of Sedana are entangled in a system of command and alliances, in which the aristocracy mixes its blood with commoners raised to Paladins and those who becomes priests or are in the private council of the Sovereign. Political games are often played out, yet in general there is harmony under the cause of sustaining Sedana as a strong and powerful nation of Avalon, and the world.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Who_are_their_religions_leaders_and_their_heirarchy_b_'></a><h2><b> Who are their religions leaders and their heirarchy</b></h2>
<br />
Religion, defined by one simple word in Sedana, would be:<br />
<br />
<a title="Zadok" href='Zadok.html' class='wiki'>Zadok</a><br />
<br />
The <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> of Justice is the God of Sedana and represents the core values of the land; it is from this being that Sedana was first built and to this day its people live by the belief that a just and right life comes from hard work, and also that only with a system in place can a country not only survive but thrive. The priests of Zadok are his representatives on the Nether Realm and as such have an elevated status, such as a High Lord. Although, no priest has ever taken advantage of such a situation - to do so would bring about severe punishment. Any one person can be accepted into the House of Faith, whereupon they can then dedicate their life to the worship of Zadok. Many people become acolytes of Zadok and from their very few can, after many years, become a priest of Zadok. The basic level of the House of Faith is the clergy, which many commoners and most of the lower nobles are. There are five High priests, all chosen by spiritual means in a private ceremony which only the priests know of.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_What_is_the_culture_outside_of_the_main_cities_like_b_'></a><h2><b>What is the culture outside of the main cities like?</b></h2>
<br />
On the western side of the Acrius mountain range the culture is one of an economically stable and wealthy nation that thrives on its natural resources and self-sufficient ways. The people live in recognition of the system and, rather than resent those who are better off or (quite possibly) those who have less responsibilities...everybody accepts things as they are and knows what it would mean to progress socially or otherwise. There is often a content feel about the major cities and those that live in smaller towns or villages enjoy their existence also. Of course there are those who do feel bitter or resentful toward their way of life, but such people rarely ever make this known publicly, nor would they act upon it for fear of punishment as it is well know that the Sovereign favours his army and the Paladins who's anger would only be stirred by a man with a wish to die.<br />
<br />
On the Eastern side of the Acrius and Boreaz mountains lie the many barracks and battle forts of Sedana, but they are not alone. It is here, especially North of Lorad, that the farms of Sedana are located. Hundreds of them, all many miles in size, stretch across the fertile land and are protected well. It is here that many Sedanians work hard and long, and live a simple life in which they find much joy. Farming on these lands is a part of, not only training for the lowest ranked soldiers, but also clerics of the House of Faith who wish to become acolytes spend many years of their life working the farms. Although a hard life, it is also simple and without many complications. The farmers and their families will often visit the cities on the Western side of the mountains, especially during harvest season and they are always welcomed by the people. But their stay can never be too long as they miss their lands on the other side of the mountains.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_How_does_the_culture_differ_between_the_classes_b_'></a><h2><b>How does the culture differ between the classes?</b></h2>
<br />
The aristocracy does not work. They live off of their inheritance and mainly engage in the political workings of Sedana. Although they live in much more wealth than the other side, it is never made obvious as it would be disrespectful to the other side to do so. Also, some of the aristocracy still hold value in the traditions of the country and are therefore aware of how easy it could be to lose their vast wealth. They are entertained in much more hedonistic ways behind their own doors and experience the most exotic aspects of Sedanian life that the other side could never possibly afford. They know it is dangerous to tread on the backs of the other side and so instead take the attitude of morbid curiosity for those who are not as fortunate as themselves.<br />
<br />
The lower noble houses and common people live in near-perfect harmony, choosing to recognise the way of things than constantly engage in conflict against one another. Any commoner can become of the noble houses and vice versa - this is something well known by every single person who is either of the lower noble houses or a commoner and so equilibrium exists. The main difference between the lower nobles and common people is that the nobles are generally better educated and more aware of the world outside of Sedana and Avalon. They also indulge in more so-called sophisticated entertainment than the common people.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_How_is_the_Army_Structured_b_'></a><h2><b>How is the Army Structured?</b></h2>
<br />
A simple structure, with a few tweaks:<br />
<br />
Lieutenant<br />
Captain<br />
Major<br />
Colonel<br />
General<br />
<br />
The Generals often command the army between themselves, however they rarely ever appear on the battle field. Instead, it is left to the Majors and Colonels to lead the individual forces.<br />
<br />
The Paladins are almost like an &quot;unseen rank&quot; within the army. They can order any part of the army, any force of any size, and can also overturn most military orders if they see fit. They have become so respected that some of them have come to command their own forces, men who have become loyal to the Paladins themselves and will fight with no-one else. These forces have become known as Zadok's Chosen, and are favoured by the priests along with their leader. Each group is known to the people by the Paladin who leads them, and are considered heroes.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_What_Armour_is_typical_b_'></a><h2><b>What Armour is typical?</b></h2>
<br />
Every soldier wears this basic set up (with the exception of the Paladins):<br />
<br />
Helm, gauntlets, breastplate, and greaves worn on the lower legs. Many soldiers choose also to wear chainmail underneath in full battle. Each part of the armour can be personalised, if the soldier can afford it and wishes to do so.<br />
<br />
Officers also wear a gorget or 'neckguard', but rarely wear a helm whilst on the battle field; though seeming foolish, they are usually at a distance from actual combat and so do not require to do so.<br />
<br />
Paladins of Zadok often wear white armour, set to their personal specifications. Most wear the basic set up, and some the officer set up. However, not many wear a helm and very often in battle do not wear a breastplate as they see it as restricting to their advanced styles of swordplay and often acrobatic fighting style.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_What_is_their_level_of_Technology_b_'></a><h2><b>What is their level of Technology?</b></h2>
<br />
Much like the rest of the world, it is medieval. There are some experiments in advancing technologies, but they are slow in their progression and receive little support from Sedana's government; in fact, they are usually funded and supported by certain members of the aristocracy. Much value is put into the basic technologies of agriculture and fishing, whilst advances in weapons of metal are deemed acceptable.<br />
