<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
When the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> changed humes into <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> there was a natural evolution of humes born with the ability to summon creatures from the <a title="Shadow Realm" href='Shadow+Realm.html' class='wiki'>Shadow Realm</a>. They were not able to use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> as <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> and <a title="Mages" href='Mages.html' class='wiki'>Mages</a> but they were able to summon lesser Shadow Realm creatures.<br />
<br />
<b>MAGIC:</b><br />
<br />
Summoning: the elder summoners are rumoured to know how to summon the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> but have taken an oath not to. They believe the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> are committing heresy by calling upon the gods and that the summoning ability was not meant to prolong life or be used to call upon the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>. It was only to be used to summon the <a title="Shadow Realm" href='Shadow+Realm.html' class='wiki'>Shadow Realm</a> creatures. These summons are numerous and varied. The summoner is able to conjure creatures at will and the summon is able to stay in the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> longer then most <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>. They are less powerful, smaller and easier to control.<br />
<br />
<b>EXTRA INFO:</b><br />
<br />
Examples of creatures summoned are;<br />
<br />
Shadow Panther<br />
Shadow Hawk<br />
Shadow Draconis<br />
<br />
Basically any animal can be summoned in its shadow form and many unique creatures to the Shadow Realm summoned too. Players are free to create creatures their summoners can call upon but must state what their character's summoning capabilities are.<br />
<br />
Creatures from the Shadow Realm have unique powers. Anything (within reason) is possible for these creatures as they are made from the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. A list of your summons abilities/magic must be included in your profile also. The summoned creatures cannot die, when they are injured they return to the Shadow Realm to rejuvenate. Some are corporeal some made of pure shadow, black mist, ethereal beings. It depends on the creature, the summoner and the experience, talent and strength of the summoner.<br />
