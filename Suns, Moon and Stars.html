The Suns of the Nether Realm are three burning orbs in the sky. The two which traverse the sky are exactly an hour apart. Utinu rises first, and Tinu sets last. The time of Zenith is when both suns are at the same height in the sky, one half and hour before noon height, the other half an hour after. First noon occurs when Utinu reaches its zenith, and second noon when Tinu reaches its zenith.<br />

<br />
From the Book of Pyra:<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><i>His first attempt to aid the light was to create a fiery creature to light All Worlds. The darkness still advanced, so he created another. That one was swallowed as well. Fire after fire he created in the sky and still the darkness claimed them. Finally, using all he had left, he made the three largest fires, Utinu, Tinu, and Morwen.</i></div><br />
<br />
<div align="center"><i>The three turned and began to repel the darkness. The battle went back and forth until the three began to advance against the darkness. Morwen advanced faster, attempting to rescue the others who had fallen. As she left the protection of her sister and brother, the darkness claimed her. She can now be seen chained in the darkness with all the lesser fires at night, above the land of Sephya in the south of the Realm of Light.</i></div><br />
<br />
<div align="center"><i>Tinu tried to do the same, but her brother stayed close. They now chase the darkness across the sky until they tire and rest.</i></div><br />
<br />
Each sun combined is the mass of our own sun. Utinu is larger then Tinu but Tinu is further away so appears smaller then it actually is. Tinu's orbit is faster the that of the larger Utinu and sets one hour earlier and is always an hour ahead of her brother.<br />
<br />
Morwen produces little heat and is at the end of its life as a star, in several billion years it will implode. She hangs morosely over Sephya, giving that land its name &quot;Land of Eternal Light&quot;<br />

<a name='_b_The_Moon_b_'></a><h1><b>The Moon</b></h1>
<br />
The pale orb that is the Nether Realms moon has seven phases. The last phase is the 'red crescent', called as such because it glows crimson in its final phase before the new moon. Legend tells us that the moon was scorched by the suns of the Realm and chased out of the sky to allow the Light to shine as a beacon. As the phases progress through the month the moon gets redder and redder. It is only completely pale on the full moon. Legend says that this is because Pyra deemed this pure moonlight acceptable and allowed it to light the dark untainted. The suns were commanded to not burn the moon at this time.<br />

<br />
The constellation of Orion is the only constellation in our world that is in the Nether Realm.<br />
