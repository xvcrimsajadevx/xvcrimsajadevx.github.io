The Embodiment of the Light, there are only ever three Light Bearers in existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aurora_b_'></a><h1><b>Aurora</b></h1>
<br />
A half elven/hume female born in Sedana but exiled to the province of Yaquinta (during the first Act of Anti Magic) where she dwelt in a tower built for her by the Mountain Elves of the Gallian Mountains. She was trained as a wizard as a child and was a talented wizard of Divination and Healing. Her whereabouts is unknown right now, but it is rumoured she may have fled through the Gates of Orion to another plane of existence in search of Orion and to flee the Thyrza Shiloh.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Orion_b_'></a><h1><b>Orion</b></h1>
<br />
A forest elf, Orion made four jewels and imbued them with the Light and the Avatar's of the four Origins in the hope that they would come forth to aid their races at the last battle. He dwelt mainly in Eramor and loved and protected that land from Darkness. For millennia he evaded the Minions who hunted him, but when he disappeared the Elves feared the worst. His name is legend amongst them now, lost, but not forgotten.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Annais_b_'></a><h1><b>Annais</b></h1>
<br />
A human who was born in the Ice Continent, he is now the King of the Regnus Glacius and is protected from the Minions by the wall of ice around his kingdom. He went missing for several years and the Wizards who were keeping an eye on him feared the worst. When he returned he shut himself away and cut all ties with the Orbis Venificus. No one is allowed to approach him and none are allowed in or out of his kingdom.<br />
