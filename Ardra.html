<b>Name:</b> Ardra<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b><br />
<br />
The City of the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> in the south of the Ice Continent. It is over 100 miles north of the Glacialis Regnum.<br />
<br />
The ancient city (and land) of the ice elves lies inside the great ice wall of Vallumglacia, half way between the wall and the hume city if Glacius Regnum. As it was the <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a> who built the ice wall the ice elves have long tried to lay claim to it. It annoys them, however, that it is the King of the Humes of Glacius Regnum that has control over it. Elves are free to come and go through it but only the ice elves can enter without permission from Annias<a href="" title="Create page: Annias"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />

<a name='_b_Capital_Ardra_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital- Ardra</b></h2>
<br />
<br />
Ardra is situated on the northern ice plains. The boundaries of their land, which they also call Ardra changes depending on the mood of the ice elves; but there are few ice elves who dwell outside of the great city, or indeed the valley with it lies in. They live near the humes but do not trust them. Refusing to let them enter their city unless they beg; ice elf guards have been known to turn away wayfarers who have then gone on to die in the desolation of the ice wastes.<br />
<br />
The city is a forlorn place; the climate not reason it is a cold place to be. The architecture is boring, their ice palaces no where near as grand as those on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are immense buildings, but they are empty and silent. They have no heart; like those who inhabit them. Ardra is at the bottom of a deep and vast valley, surrounded and protected by the Encircling Mountains and cut off from the pathetic humes by a wide and deep fissure to the south. The Ameda Bridge is the longest in the world and breaches the fissure, and is the only way across it, the only entrance into Ardra. It was made by the ice elves, a feat they believe outstrips anything the mountain elves have ever built, including the Vallumglacia. They made two statues they call the Sentinels which guard the only entrance into the city. Two monolithic white statues, their faces resembling hume woman and their bodies that of griffins. They have been imbued with strange ice elf magics and will not allow passage to anyone not of ice elf blood. Their eyes glow when someone who is not an ice elf steps across the threshold. If the person does not hastily turn back or the elf guards do not placate the Sentinels then the eyes shoot a beam of bright light and turn the stranger to stone. These petrified visitors are never healed and instead thrown into the fissure to the south.<br />
<br />
Ardra is invisible, but not via any elf magic. The snow and blends with the white buildings, hiding it from the air. If you did not know a city existed you would not see anything there but an empty valley covered in snow. Once past the Sentinels it is hard to locate, especially in the dark. Ardra is not a welcoming place, and even though it is an elven Sanctuary few other alamia venture here through choice.<br />

<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
The region of Ardra is the land the ice elves claimed between the Vallumglacier and the Glacias Regnum. Most of it is uninhabited, and the city is where most ice elves will be found. To reach the ice wall one must travel through this region. The ice elves maintain the roads and ask for toll payment upon them. If a hume decides to travel off the roads then they will most likely get lost and killed in the snow storms of the ice wastes.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
There is no hierarchy within Ardra other then the Ice nobility. These Eldest Families rule their own sectors of the city and lay claim to certain regions of the land of Ardra. The Sanctuary is still under the rule of the elven high council, and it is the ice elf representatives that are the leaders of this region, even though they spend most of their time on Lenal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
There is no religion. <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> do not even worship <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. Their culture is one of xenophobia, mistrust and envy. Their rituals more tribal then most other alamia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
<ul><li> No humes allowed into Ardra without permission from the Ice Elves.
</li><li> No elves that aren't of the Ice alamia allowed into Ardra for the first time without prior permission (this is one of the reasons why Ardra is not the place to go if one is fading...)
</li><li> No travel through the elf elf gates of the Vallumglacier unless permitted by nobility.
</li><li> No common alamia allowed into the imperial buildings without permission.
</li><li> No trade with the humes.
</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
The only trade is between other alamia and the ice giants of Kurn.<br />
