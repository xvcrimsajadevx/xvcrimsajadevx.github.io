<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
The average age of death is around 80 years. No Vigil has ever lived beyond 90. Old age does not affect them until they exceed their seventieth year. They do not become frail in old age.<br />
<br />
All Vigilia have black, straight hair, tilted dark eyes and high cheek bones. It is very rare to see a Vigilia that slouches.<br />
<br />
For a description of Vigil women who have an active occupation, see occupation descriptions. Vigil women without an active occupation dress as the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> women as in essence they are adopted into the Quasi Tribe.<br />
<br />
For a description of Vigil men all have an active occupation, see occupation descriptions. Those who retire into the Quasi Tribe dress as the Quasi men.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Vigil tends to choose their occupations according to their personality and skills.<br />
<br />
A Vigils occupation can ‘find them’ (a term used by the Teachers) when traits of their personality manifest and become prominent. This happens usually in the early years of puberty when their general training intensifies.<br />
<br />
Most Vigils’ are cool headed, devout, protective of the Quasi Tribes, dedicated to their occupations, philosophical about life, brave, and loyal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Vigilian_Vita_Via_b_'></a><h1><b>The Vigilian Vita Via</b></h1>
<br />
All Vigil have must come to their Vita Via - or &quot;Life Way&quot;. When a woman decides to bear children she goes into the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> tribe to raise them. She does not return to Vita Via after this. (Due to this there have been quite a few occasions where Quasi men and Vigil women have relationships.)<br />
<br />
Vigil men stay in their Vita Via until the age of 69. After 70, some become ‘Teachers’ the others retire into the Quasi tribe.<br />
<br />
There are two levels of a Vigil. These are;<br />
<br />
<b>Junior</b> - Custos<br />
<br />
<b>Senior</b> - Excubitor<br />
<br />
For example, a Custos Flyer, is an apprentice Flyer, and an Excubitor Defender is a fully trained Defender.<br />
<br />
The Vita Via can be decided for them by <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> priests or it can simply &quot;come to them&quot;, often in dreams or during their time in a meditative state.<br />
<br />
The different Vita Via are as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Defenders_b_'></a><h2><b>Defenders</b></h2>
<br />
Guard-like warriors who often take watch over encampments. The highest ranking Quasi, along with the most powerful, are assigned sometimes two Defenders as personal bodyguards - especially when they need to travel away from the group. They are very often bonded to a sword (usually single-handed yet long) and are the only Vigilia that also have proficiency in using shields. Their natural gift is a swifter healing of wounds.<br />
<br />
All Defenders carry these basic physical characteristics:<br />
<br />
Stout<br />
Tall<br />
Well built<br />
Shaved head<br />
Tattooed face<br />
<br />
All Defenders wear padded armour which reaches from their shoulders to their feet. They wear skull cap helmets which reach around from the back to the sides of their necks - these are usually worn only on duty and rarely ever on personal guard. They are often cloaked, hiding their armour but always identifiable to other Vigils and Quasi by their tattoos.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Weapons_Masters_b_'></a><h2><b>Weapons Masters</b></h2>
<br />
The most soldier-like warriors of the Vigil, they are proficient in all weaponry. They can often seem like a sleeping tiger, but they are in fact predators ready to pounce at the first sign of a threat. They are the most learned of the Vigilia in the art of war. The majority of captains and highest ranking officers tend to be Weapons Masters. They very often bond to their tomahawk which represents the instinctive persona that is more dominant within the Weapons Masters. It is the embodiment of the Vigils Final Battle and only used when they believe they will be fighting to the death. It carries their honour in battle and must be used as their last weapon in life, laying beside them in death. They are also the only Vigilia who can, on rare occasions, bond with any other weapon due to the sacredness of the tomahawk which only a Weapons Master can wield.<br />
<br />
Their natural gifts are lightning speed and dexterity when in the heat of battle.<br />
<br />
As the soldiers of the Vigilia they are always on the front line, the most ferocious and faithful to the Quasi. They live and die by their oaths and remain dedicated to battle until the end.<br />
<br />
All Weapons Masters carry these basic physical characteristics:<br />
<br />
Stout<br />
Tall<br />
Well built<br />
Right side of head shaved, left sided hair braided into a thick tress.<br />
Right side of neck has a single small tattoo denoting their family crest.<br />
<br />
All Weapons Masters wear padded shoulder guard, cloaks in bad weather, and soft knee high boots. Light breeches, rawhide shirts (these are often practical rather then extravagant or individual). The Weapons Masters all bear their forearms which reveal the most heavily tattooed part of their body. These tattoos are the first thing that most other Vigilia recognise them by.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Scouts_b_'></a><h2><b>Scouts</b></h2>
<br />
Keen eyesight, nimbleness of foot, brilliant hearing.<br />
<br />
<br />
All Scouts carry these basic physical characteristics:<br />
<br />
Slight, yet athletic.<br />
Well toned<br />
Lean<br />
Short, usually shorter then 5’8<br />
Hair is never below shoulder length, and braided in many short tresses. When on duty must be pulled up onto the top of their head and out of the way. Braids must always be kept short as when they are on duty it must be out of the face for clear vision.<a href="" title="Create page: When+on+duty+must+be+pulled+up+onto+the+top+of+their+head+and+out+of+the+way.+Braids+must+always+be+kept+short+as+when+they+are+on+duty+it+must+be+out+of+the+face+for+clear+vision."  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Also when on duty the symbols shaved into the sides of their head are prominent.<br />
<br />
All Scouts wear little clothing, but if they do wear more than normal it'll be all natural colours so as to blend in with their environment regardless of where it is; due to their tendency to stay away from cities, they have never found the need to create urban-coloured clothing. More common than clothing is the use of natural camouflage, taken from various plants depending on the colour but it is often black, green, brown or various shades of these.<br />
<br />
They are unique amongst even their own people in that they have no items that mark them out as scouts at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Flyers_aka_Avatars_b_'></a><h2><b>Flyers/aka/Avatars</b></h2>
<br />
Night vision, born with, are the only ones that can communicate to their steeds, born with their steeds as well as their weapons. Telepathic ability only with other Flyers, called Whisper on the Wind. It is not known whether this in inborn in flyers or whether they develop it as they train, however it is something that has become even more rare then the flyers themselves. The creatures they are bonded to are called Harkai, a word that the Vigilia loosely translated as ‘shadow bird’.<br />
<br />
All Flyers carry these basic physical characteristics:<br />
<br />
Wiry<br />
Athletic<br />
Flexible<br />
Strong well toned, lean, flexible legs and arms<br />
Albino eyes, but at night they irises go red<br />
Short in height, no taller then 5’4’’<br />
They are the only Vigil to not have their hair braided. It is always long, always untied and always free flowing. Most have it to their waists and no shorter then half way down their backs.<br />
<br />
All Flyers wear very little, much like the scouts; in fact, they were next to no clothing and when they appear in public - which is on extremely rare occasions - always get raised eyebrows and sometimes people make fuss over how &quot;offensive&quot; their appearance is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Teachers_b_'></a><h2><b>Teachers</b></h2>
<br />
These are retired Vigils who wish to pass on their knowledge and wisdom to another generation. They are often former generals or sergeants and tend to be Defenders for some unknown reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Notes_on_the_Vita_Via_b_'></a><h1><b>Notes on the Vita Via</b></h1>
<br />
All classes have a shoulder guard, on their right shoulder (which may or may not be armoured, depending on class). These shoulder guards display class and rank. There class is represented by a sigil, whilst their rank is denoted by the number of symbols underneath their sigil. The representative symbols are:<br />
<br />
<b>Defenders:</b> Shield<br />
<b>Weapons Master:</b> Sword<br />
<b>Flyers/Avatars:</b> Feather<br />
<b>Teachers:</b> The Ouroboros symbol<br />
<br />
(Note within a note: Teachers are not active and therefore do not have a rank.)<br />
<br />
(Second note within a note: Scouts are exempt from any form of identity, as they are more liable to be seen by enemies.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Technology_and_Magic_b_'></a><h1><b>Technology and Magic</b></h1>
<br />
As a nomadic tribe the Vigil rely on the land. They are not keen on technological advances as they come from the ‘Outside’. Their faith is deeply embedded in a respect and trust of nature. Although they do not disrespect technology, they have no need for it, especially since they are bonded with the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a>, who are in no way technological.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Vigil themselves do not create magic, and have never been able to. However, their bond with the Nether Realm is one that can provide natural gifts which with other races perceive to be supernatural abilities. This is a misconception as these ‘gifts’ are a result of their unique evolution. They are enhancements of the basic human abilities. Examples can be found in the occupation section.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Their_Place_in_History_b_'></a><h1><b>Their Place in History</b></h1>
<br />
The Vigilia are descendants of the people who lived alongside the ancient Quasi on the island of Aether. They were humans with no magical abilities who were oath-sworn to protect the island of Aether from attack. As they could not summon they raised an army.<br />
<br />
The ancient oath sworn by the Vigilia ancestors was firstly; a vow to the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> to keep the balance of the planet and maintain karma.<br />
Secondly; a pledge to the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> dedicating themselves to the protection of the summoners and the secret of the twinned-soul prophecy…<br />
<br />
When Aether was destroyed by an unknown entity, they fled with the Quasi and were dispersed over all of the Nether Realm; their oaths fulfilled, having defended Aether with their lives, the survivors still hold to that ancient oath, not held by the Quasi but by their loyalty to Aether. The modern Vigilia believes that by continuing to protect the Quasi and aid them in their own quest the Vigilia will increase their honour and die worthy of rebirth. This is because they have kept the natural balance with the Nether Realm by protecting the summoners, making it possible for them to summon the Eria who they believe will maintain the balance of the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
Protecting the Quasi was more then just a job or agreement, there was an oath, but the Quasi provided their own type of protection for the women and the children of the Vigil, taking them into their tribe, and as well as the obvious protection there was also an easier life for the women and children then the militant life of the Vigilia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Philosophy_and_religion_of_the_Vigilia_b_'></a><h1><b>Philosophy and religion of the Vigilia</b></h1>
<br />
The souls of the Vigilia are unbound. When they die they do not go to <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> and are not consumed by the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, they are reborn. No one knows why this race seemed to have escaped the Curse of the Darkness. Their bodies are not immortal, but their souls are. Some believe the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> Moriqeeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqeeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Ta'Ko<a href="" title="Create page: Ta%27Ko"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> have something to do with this.<br />
<br />
They believe in equilibrium with Nature. They believe in reincarnation and karma, very much a steadfast belief, very spiritual and meditative, they believe that the final fight is everything and there is great honour in giving their lives in battle as they are confident that the earth with absorb their bodies. Through this they believe that their spirits will be reborn, cleansed by their honour in this life.<br />
<br />
Their philosophies are now more prevalent in their characters. The majority of Vigils’ now keep to the notions that the place of their people in the grand scheme of things is beyond their control and yet, despite fulfilling karma they must still keep their faith in the Nether Realm and the cycle of life, death and rebirth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Nature_Of_the_Vigilia_Of_this_warrior_race_b_'></a><h1><b>The Nature Of the Vigilia, Of this warrior race</b></h1>
<br />
The Vigilia were made exactly one hundred years from the moment when the first <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> was brought into the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> settled on Aether<a href="" title="Create page: Aether"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are a warrior race, with a natural equilibrium to the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
Originally from Aether, they left with the Quasi tribes and travel with them as Nomads. The Vigilia are in tribes of no more then 100 Vigil travelling with tribes of no more then 100 Quasi Summoners. Sometimes tribes join and travel together for a while, swelling their numbers to beyond 100. However this never lasts long and usually serves specific purposes; even if certain members from both groups find other benefits from it they do not travel together for longer then is absolutely needed and inevitably go their separate ways. It should be noted that these partings are rarely acrimonious.<br />
