<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a><br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> 700 years<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
The Alatus are a winged race and have feathered wings of different sizes and colours. They are quite small and thin, to support themselves in flight they have to be that way naturally. Most Alatus do not grow above 5'7<i>, for males, and around 5'3</i> for females.<br />
<br />
When in <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> there is a distinct difference in dress amongst the rich and the poor. The rich wear silks and grand colourful flowing gowns, adorning their wings with jewels. Whereas the poor wear basic cottons, usually in blacks and whites, shades which the nobles never wear. All Alatus go barefooted in <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>. The rich wearing toe rings and anklets of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
They are a xenophobic nation, very few leave and those that do are adventurers and traders. Those that do leave the winged city have to get permission from the Empress.<br />
<br />
The Alatus are very particular and can be quite haughty. They feel above most people, especially the nobles, they are the most conceited of all. Often deemed as snooty, looking down their noses at other races, and each other, they are deeply involved in the politics of their race, always trying to get one over on each other. But they will stick together when faced with outsiders, because nothing is worse then an outsider.<br />

<br />
The Alatus are the second race <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> made and were made in her image, somewhat. They were imbued with most of her powers, but were no where near as strong as the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a>. The Alatus took Tempests grief to heart and blamed the rest of the world. They are rarely seen on the land, and when they do go on land they disguise themselves as normal <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a>. They hide who they are and blend in to whatever country or race they are among, hiding their wings and tuck them under their clothes.<br />
<br />
The History of the Alatus is known only to its natives. They are a mysterious and xenophobic people, their public libraries prohibited to non-Alatus and deep within the city of <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>. The Imperial Family have their own historical records, and that secret history is only ever known to those of Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
Despite its name, <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> has never been at war. The <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a> have attempted to bring war to the city but have never succeeded. It never stays in the same place and has such powerful magical barriers any attack is repelled easily. The Alatus are a strange race with an even stranger secret history. All the records outside of <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> state that ‘the floating isle has always been, and the winged beings have always been unfriendly’.<br />

The Alatus do not use blades. Land bound Alatus wield quarterstaffs (which are made from the wood of the Abiegnus Tree, native only to the Floating Isle of <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>) and use their air magics with them, disguised as a normal walking staff (magic runes engraved into every staff). The only other weapon you will see an Alatus use is a silver bow made in <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>, they will use no other bow. Some of the High Blood (Royalty) are schooled in the use of light daggers and knives. No heavy weapon is worth learning as they fight mainly when airborne. When fighting on the ground they use their magics and staffs.<br />
<br />
A bustling metropolis the Alatus have many professions inside of their city, but only merchants’ travel outside. Inside there are the professions you would find in most human<a href="" title="Create page: human"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> cities, traders, weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, tailors, healers. The Nobility live inside the Palace grounds and have no occupation. Their wealth is passed down in their families. It is believed that they own gold mines all over The Nether Realm and employ merchants to sell the wares made from the goldsmiths in the cities. <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> has a great trade quarter, the only place outsiders are allowed.<br />

<br />
<br />
<a title="Tallina Enlil" href='Tallina+Enlil.html' class='wiki'>Tallina Enlil</a> - The Empress, holder of the Wind Throne is the leader of the Alatus. House Enlil is the most direct line of the Divine Blood of the Alatus. Where other lines have failed, House Enlil remains firm. The Imperial Family has been Enlil for three thousand years.<br />
<br />
The Palace of the Four Winds is a magnificent structure. Tall towers of aeries and golden domes rise up from the centre of the city, a focal point and a landmark for miles around. In the centre of the Palace is the throne room where the Empress sits on the Wind Throne.<br />
<br />
The Great Abiegnus Tree, (native only to the Floating Isle of Volatilis) is believed to have been planted by the goddess of the four winds herself (what the Alatus call <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a>). The empress is of Divine Blood, a descendent of the Ancient Goddess (<a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a> is believed to have mated with the first male Alatus made by <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>, making the Imperial Family descendants of the First Alatus made by <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> and the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a>). The High Blood (Royalty) are weaker in the blood(they are descended from the Alatus created after the First), but only the blood can claim the Wind Throne. The societies and politics of the Alatus are complicated.<br />
<br />
The Blood are split into Noble Houses, Houses as old as the Imperial Family. Some are banished from <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>, some lose their places due to loss of fortune and heirs, but most are consistent and long standing in Alatus society.<br />
<br />
House Enlil - Imperial Family<br />
<br />
House Ayperi - Oldest House apart from Enlil. Often breeds enemies of Enlil.<br />
<br />
House Aricia - Has been allied with the Imperial Family for centuries, marriages are common between the two.<br />
<br />

<br />
House Saree - Owns many of the theatres in the Social Quarter, the youngest house, but making its mark on the Royal court. Is very popular with the common Alatus.<br />
<br />
House Aldara - The head of this house is allied to Enlin, but there is anarchy in its ranks as some of the higher members of Aldara are allied with Ayperi.<br />
<br />
House Tiernan - Tends to appear neutral but masters of political machinations and intrigue.<br />
