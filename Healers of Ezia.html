<br />
<br />
<b>RACE:</b> This group are human magic users not trained in wizardry or sorcery. They worship the Djinn of Healing, Ezia, and like the Druids of Omri and the Wizards of Divination and Healing, they are the best healers in the world, but VERY hard to find.<br />
<br />
<b>COUNTRY/REGION:</b> It is believed the temple of Ezia is on a hidden island in the Evadne Sea.<br />
<br />
<b>LIFESPAN: </b>The Healer's have the lifespan of wizard's.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b><br />
<br />
Always dressed in their temple garb, white robes, cloaks and shoes. When they do travel abroad they wear these same clothes making them easily distinguishable. They usually have their faces covered by their huge white hoods on their cloaks as they do not wish to be approached. They also always travel in groups of at least five when they leave Ezia's Island.<br />
<br />
<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b><br />
<br />
They rarely speak, never chanting spells they stick to hand movements and mind majicks to complete their healing. When they do speak it is in quiet tones and soft voices, never raising their voice or being argumentative.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
As a cult of a <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> the beginnings of this group are murky. <a title="Ezia" href='Ezia.html' class='wiki'>Ezia</a> is one of the most elusive Djinns and it is believed she does not even grace her island very often. She does not recruit, her people are a myth and their existence not believed by most. When people in white cloaks and robes are seen it is believed they are only mimicking the Healers, no one knows who is a genuine Healer most of the time.<br />
<br />
Fewer Healers have appeared in the world, lending to the rumour that their numbers are dwindling.<br />
