The <a class="wiki"  href="http://www.thenetherrealm.com/wiki/Majick.html">lore</a> of this world must be adhered to and it must be noted that demons cannot use many of their (powerful) inherent majicks in the Nether Realm, but have full use of their power in their home realm and the Other Realms.<br />
<br />
Demons are races of the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and can be applied for by new members (if you apply for a character that is a member of your original demon race before you can submit the character profile you MUST submit the demon race application and get it accepted first.)<br />
<br />
Demons live in the <a title="Other Worlds" href='Other+Worlds.html' class='wiki'>Other Worlds</a>, in their own Realms of Darkness and are numerous and able to travel into the Nether Realm via gates. Sometimes it is impossible for them to travel back and they may be damaged from using the gate, experience amnesia or serious injury as a result. Some can never enter the Nether Realm but we have an area of the board where members can RP in the demon realms.<br />

If a member wishes to create a new demon realm they MUST apply for it and fill in the <a title="Location Application Template" href='Location+Application+Template.html' class='wiki'>Location Application Template</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE:<br />
<br />
<ul><ul><li>We are very critical when it comes to demons and will ask that if they do not come from one of the existing demon realms then you must also complete a <a title="Location Application Template" href='Location+Application+Template.html' class='wiki'>Location Application Template</a> and have that accepted alongside your demon race application (you may apply for both within the same topic if you wish and they are related).
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>We will be very strict regarding powers and will not accept anime type profiles or anything which is too sci fi.
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>If you wish to apply for a demon race then fill in this template and submit it to the forums profile application forum.
