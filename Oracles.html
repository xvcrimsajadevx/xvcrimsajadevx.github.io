The Oracles can be found all over the Nether Realm. Their majick is mysterious but Arcemedes believes it is rooted in the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. Their beginings are believed to be rooted in the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> themselves. Some believe that they are aspects of the Origins. Only the worthy can approach them and it is very hard to find them. Their wisdom and powers are not always worth the price one has to pay to gain them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Not known<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Oracles can take any form within their Hollow, but if they travel outside of their Circle of Omniscience, then they become mere mortals. Always female and always enchantingly beautiful when they go abroad from their Sacred Ground. This however is rare as they risk death. Therefore they are bound to the Hallowed Ground if they wish to remain alive. Inside the Circle they are immortal and cannot be killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_of_the_Oracles_b_'></a><h1><b>History of the Oracles</b></h1>
<br />
Many centuries ago, when the world took its first breath, there were four Gods. These Gods, or Origins, ruled over the inhabitants of the world, maintaining the delicate balance between order and chaos, war and peace, and doing their part to keep the lives of their people happy. As the races grew and developed, the Origins retreated from the Nether Realm and created the Oracles.<br />
<br />
At first there were nine Oracles. Two served in the name of Titan, two in the name of Pyra, two in the name of Azure and two in the name of Tempest. Each of them were imbued with all the wisdom and power their master contained and were scattered to the different corners of the world to help maintain the peace and be wise advisors to the people they served. One, the last, served in the largest part of the World, in a land known today as Avalon. This Oracle was given all the wisdom of all of the Origins along with all the Ether ability they had among them. All the other Oracles were connected to her, and through her, to each other. In this way, no matter where in the world a person was, they could reach the Gods through an Oracle.<br />
<br />
The Oracles were central figures in their communities. They were loved and respected but they were human and therefore mortal. As the seasons changed, so did the Oracles and slowly they left the Nether Realm to rejoin their Gods and creators. Again the Origins came to the Nether Realm in search of new Oracles. Many young women aspired for such an appointment, not fully understanding what it meant, but seeking the power and respect that came with the name. The Gods, in their infinite wisdom granted the new Oracles eternal life and once again gave them all the power and knowledge they had.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of years passed and all was well, but as power usually does, the Oracles became corrupt, desirous of power and convinced that their Godlike powers could gain them anything they desired. Those charged with maintaining peace and balance began to take over, by force when necessary and the balance of the Nether Realm was tipped. A very long and very destructive war between the Oracles and the Origins ripped across the world. The shape of the world was forever changed, some races were wiped from the face of the earth while others were created. The war lasted so long that many born into the world lived their entire life and died never knowing peace. In the end, the Origins won, the Oracles were erased and peace was restored to a destroyed realm.<br />
<br />
But the usefulness of the Oracles could not be forgotten and so, again, the Origins chose women to become Oracles. They chose quiet women, women with humble lives and no desires for power. These women were given the knowledge of all of the Origins, equals to each other in what they knew. The only difference among them was their ability with the Ether. Each was given a measure of the ability of their Origin. They were no longer powerful beings, nor were they granted everlasting life. The Origins assigned each of them a home, a Hallowed place where they were to serve their people. Inside this Hallowed place they were immortal, never aging and protected from the angers of the races. Outside the Hallow they would age like any other being and were vulnerable to the dangers of the world.<br />
<br />
Finally the Origins had found the perfect balance between knowledge and power, and everything seemed perfect. The Oracles were present in the world, travelling, advising, mediating and maintaining the perfect balance. But their name had been sullied, the world no longer had the same respect for them; many even feared them, and so one by one they withdrew into their Hallows and stayed there. Immortal within their Hallows, the Oracles have lived for millennia, locked within their sanctuaries.<br />
<br />
Today, there are 6 known Oracles, each with their own unique abilities and personalities. There are 7 others who are unknown.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick:</b></h1>
<br />
It depends on their allegiance. If they serve an origin, they tend to reflect the origin they serves elemental powers. Likewise, if they serve a Djinn or Eria they will have magic that is similar to that of their master. Those Oracles who are independent have powers that only the gods may know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Miscellaneous_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Miscellaneous Information:</b></h1>
<br />
The Oracles are mystic spirits bound to Existence. They are a race made from the Ether, and some suspect they they were made by some of the Djinn and Eria, but no one knows for certain.<br />
<br />
Some of the Oracles serve the origins, and some the Djinn and Eria.<br />
<br />
They speak in riddles and can be malicious or friendly, depending on whom they answer to and their mood. They know all, and are the fountains of knowledge; great prices have to be paid for their wisdom. Some believe that price is always too high.<br />
<br />
It was believed that there were originally 13 Oracles, but only 6 are known to the world.<br />
<br />
Maybe there are more, only the Gods know. It is possible that the Djinn make more oracles according to their need. Some protect great treasures, some hold the keys to great majicks and spells.<br />
<br />
All original oracles are female. their offspring have similar powers and can be male or female (but only females inherit their powers.)<br />

<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> Nothing is known of the origins of the mountain Oracle, only that she was created at the beginning of time and has roots deep in the mountains. Before the Mountains she was a statue in a grove in the country of Gallian.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> She is a statue who sits cross legged upon the still lake inside a swirling pillar of water.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> The Water Oracle is constantly suspended on the lake, hovering eternally. Only those that can walk on water are allowed to approach her. Anyone who tries to swim to her are drowned in the lake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Fire_Oracle_b_'></a><h2><b>The Fire Oracle</b></h2>
<br />
<b>LOCATION:</b> Inside the Volcano Vesta, on Lenal.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> Four arms, a halo of fire atop her head, three flaming eyes, and a body wreathed in fire. Her veins stand out and glow as if magma runs through them<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> The Fire Oracle has always dwelt close to the Rock of Ages... the myths and legends state that she has a desire to be near Titan and that long ago she begat a child of him. A new race supposedly came from this union. She dwells deep within the molten lava of Vesta and her shrine is dripping in the liquid rock. A single, narrow walkway is suspended across this swirling lake of fire and rock and leads directly to her pedestal.<br />
<br />
For any of the races of Titan there is no price to pay for her knowledge and they are welcomed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Wind_Oracle_b_'></a><h2><b>The Wind Oracle</b></h2>
<br />
<b>LOCATION:</b> Her shrine is on an island south of Aether. You know when you are near because compasses spin wildly.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> Naked, ethereal, amorphous, her face shifts between corporeal and a shimmer of air and light.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> The Wind Oracle's shrine is within a tornado that dies down every 50 years. Other then that only those that can withstand the cyclone can enter her shrine. Within her shrine fierce winds blow and you must grab stone, tree, or vine to stop yourself from being blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Forest_Oracle_b_'></a><h2><b>The Forest Oracle</b></h2>
<br />
<b>LOCATION:</b> The Forest Oracle resides in the Tirilian Forest in western Eramor. Her shrine is not far from the Faery Ring.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> Wrapped in vines and with hair of moss, and skin that is taut and olive, her sultry body is a temptation for both elves and men.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> The Forest Oracle is notorious for making her adventurers work for their answers. Her riddles are almost unsolvable and her price is always too high.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Ice_Oracle_aka_Skadi_b_'></a><h2><b>The Ice Oracle (aka Skadi)</b></h2>
<br />
<b>LOCATION:</b> Sephya, the southern most land on the Ice Continent. The sun Morwen gives eternal light on this land and illuminates the ice oracles shrine. She maintains the ice that makes the shrines, making it the only thing in the land where there is ice. For a land so far south Sephya is very unusual and the oracles shrine is the only thing normal about it.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> Wrapped in white furs and silken robes, her body appears to be that of solid ice. Her hod is trimmed with snow white fur and obscures her eyes and upper part of her face. Her lips are blue and her hands hidden in her furred sleeves.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> The Ice Oracle is a calm and calculating female, beautiful and deadly. If she likes the look of you she will turn you into an Ice stature. The knowledge of an Oracle always comes at a price, and for those that visit the ice oracle, after the treacherous journey south, few return.<br />
<br />
Few ever reach Sephya, as entrance into the Glacius Regnum is restricted and you need to pass through the Ice Kingdom to reach the Ice Shrine.<br />

<a name='_b_The_Death_Oracle_The_Raven_b_'></a><h2><b>The Death Oracle (The Raven)</b></h2>
<br />
<br />
<b>LOCATION:</b> The Death Oracle resides in the very center of Kyoklys.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> Shrouded in dark colors of deep blue, purple and black, she covers half of her beautiful face with a hooded cloak that is cut around her outfit in a way that, if worn on a normal woman, would be so sensual it would make men insane with desire. Her waist is clad in what seems to be a large, armored belt in her three colors. But the mere presence of death that comes when she fixes her gaze upon some one through the cloak over her eyes, her pale &amp; serene face statuesque, is enough to chill any warmth in their blood.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> The Raven, as she is known, is often very personal with those she visits. She will bring messages &amp; warnings to people if she believes there be need enough, though most that recieve her message come to her, seeking information on their own mortality, their questions rarely differing or unique.<br />
She keeps her sword with her during a visit as a reminder that her message comes with a meaning, and it is as real as the Exotath at her hip.<br />
The price that comes with visiting her will depend upon the question and her answer, which is usually a price in and of itself.<br />

<a name='_b_The_Destiny_Oracle_Viki_b_'></a><h2><b>The Destiny Oracle (Viki)</b></h2>
<br />
<br />
<b>LOCATION:</b> Lacenta Archipelago, Tern Island<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b> Viki's hollow is unique, located in one of the island's forests. On the outside, it looks like a simple wooden cabin that has seen better days with rotting wood. Upon entering, one would instantly feel like they would be in a strange world, as if someone has just literally entered a Chagall mosaic. Different paths form a large maze, where the walls are decorated with blue skies and grassy fields that look very realistic. For some strange reason, doors float in mid-space, while some doors lead to an open field of flowers inside a colorful room. Her hollow is a maze, and it takes a long sense of patience to be able to get to the end of the hollow where Viki resides. In short, every part of the hollow is strange and unorthodox. Below the the feet of those exploring the hollow shows is a transparent glass, with different parts of the world being viewed all at once as if it were a live video.<br />
