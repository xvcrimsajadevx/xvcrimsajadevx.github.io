The City of Gates the sinister city of Abyssus has within its walls the Gateways to the Other Worlds. Maintained and marshalled by the Aluka<a href="" title="Create page: Aluka"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Abyssus is a city of death for anyone who is not authorised to be there. Even Lamia<a href="" title="Create page: Lamia"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are restricted. This city can be seen from miles off, above it is a luminous whirlpool of lightning, this cyclone is not a natural event but caused by the tears in reality to create the gateways within the city.<br />
