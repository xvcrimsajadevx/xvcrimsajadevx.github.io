<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b><br />
<br />
The novum’s above all else love battle, it’s almost as if they were born and bred purely for fighting and they never feel content unless there’s another battle on the horizon.<br />
<br />
An aspect of the family’s mindframe that most take care to note is the length of time which they hold grudges for, having never forgiven the treasons of Rodmer’s half brothers they have always striven to be as loyal as possible to their king. They are often at the forefront of battles for the realm.<br />
<br />
Despite their appearance and history some of the house have been known to have quite good senses of humour and are not too high and noble to sup with common men in inns and join in with jests. Being lords hasn’t gone to their heads.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
Early on in the history of humans in the Nether Realm when the first men were pushing their way across the land of Fenlar House Novum had not yet come to be. According to Aqenlar’s records the first mentioning of the name Novum coming to prominence during the series of skirmishes between Sedana and Fenlar after Sedana’s invasion. In these skirmishes Abelic Novum was a young soldier known for his size and brute strength. During the skirmishes he found himself being rapidly promoted through the ranks of the company he served in due to his prowess both in battle and at surviving in harsh conditions. In the battles that follow Abelic is known to have led groups of men and been monumental in the recapture of Udenya when it had fallen.<br />
<br />
This remains to this day the only significant information about the family for over 100 years, during this gap it is assumed that Abelic must have taken a wife for men claiming to be descended from him were at the forefront of a mercenary movement in central Fenlar. Due to a rising bandit problem in the area some of the people of Fenlar had come together to create a mercenary band meant for the guarding of settlements throughout the land. This band was not for humans only however and had attracted a number of dwarves and even a few elves from the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
It is assumed by the scholars and historians in Aqenlar that during the years that followed the mercenary group had been involved in routing out a number of significant bandit groups in the area. What is known for sure about this period in history is that at some point amidst the destruction of the various bandit groups a wooden fort had been thrown up in what would one day become Aqenlar. The fort served as a base of operations for the mercenary group and allowed both the Dwarf and Elf member’s easy access to their colonies in the Mountains.<br />
Quite a few men in the fort were descendants of Abelic Novum yet none seemed to have been made from the same mould, none except the one who had been placed in charge of the Fort and its garrison. The man in charge of the garrison was the 6th son of Dermund Novum, this man’s 5 brothers had a different mother than him so in truth they were but half-brothers. Who Dermund had taken as his wife is lost in time, myth says it was a great female bear and it is this that has made the men of House Novum such rugged men. No doubt it is simply the fact they have lived in a rough area and endured rough times for who knows how long.<br />
<br />
This 6th son of Dermund was Rodmer Novum, a great brute of a man known for his viciousness in battle and ability to strike fear into the hearts of almost any man. His appointment as Commander of the Aqenlar garrison (as it had now been named) didn’t go down over well with his half-brothers. Together they plotted and managed to recruit a few men to their cause, in a coup attempt the five men accompanied by those who they had coaxed to their side charged Rodmer’s bedchambers one night and would have put him to the sword were it not for the aid of his squire and two close friends. These two friends had been the stoutest of Rodmer’s companions both in and out of battle and people who seen them together would have laughed were they not deathly afraid of Rodmer. The reason for this was the race of the two, one was an Elf called Kordre Alaen’rretryn and a Dwarf whose name is lost in history.<br />
<br />
A fierce battle ensued and Rodmer was injured quite bad, losing an eye to an attack by one of his brothers. All of the men enlisted by his brothers fell in that room, of his brothers only one had been captured the other fleeing into the night. Filled with rage from the treason Rodmer beat his half-brother senseless, refusing to have his wound treated until he proved a point. He had some men from the garrison drive a large block of wood into the ground in the center of the assembly grounds, he had his half brother tied to this and the area was fenced off and a guard was put on it.<br />
For a while all that was heard in the area was the sobbing cries of a dying man, constantly pleading for a quick death. It is said that each day Rodmer would get up early and look on this brother with his remaining eye. When the man finally died the garrison was called out to the assembly grounds and commanded to look upon the shrivelled corpse of Rodmer’s half brother, there on that day Rodmer told the men to look long and hard and think well before they ever sought to usurp a man of Novum for the price of treason is steep and few men find that they can pay it.<br />
<br />
In the coming years Rodmer would hold the command of this garrison yet the power of the mercenary band itself would fade throughout the land as stronger groups of bandits rose, some say led by Rodmer’s surviving half-brothers. Known fondly by the men under his command as the One-Eyed<a href="" title="Create page: One-Eyed" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Bear Rodmer kept the lands around Aqenlar and areas of the mountain safe with both the help of the Dwarves and Elves along with humans who volunteered right up until his death. Upon his death the command of the garrison was handed over to the strongest of Rodmer’s sons, Abelic the II. Abelic would prove himself more than worthy of the name throughout his life, heeding the counsel of his father’s dwarven and elven friends he would solidify the alliance between Aqenlar and the various colonies of other respective races in the area, maintaining the upper hand over the bandits who were in fact led by the sons of his father’s half-brothers.<br />
<br />
Over the next few hundred years the fort came to the end of its use as a stronger defence was required for the men, the dwarves offered to help craft a strong fortress from the mountains themselves. By this stage the elves that had remained with the Novum’s band of mercenaries had all faded or returned to their lands and no new ones had been sighted for some time, the alliance between them weaker than ever. The fort which was built from the mountains took a long time to finish; by the time it was done all of the years of skirmishes against the bandits and their efforts to keep certain settlements fine attracted the current king’s attention. Since the Dwarves had more or less helped in building a seat for the Novum’s the King granted Abelic IIII a lordship. For the name of the fort they used Aqenlar once more.<br />
<br />
As Lords of Aqenlar the Novum’s continued their work against rebel’s, brigands and bandits of all sorts, Aqenlar itself became quite a stronghold and the men of House Novum only got bigger and stronger as they adapted to the hard life of living in the mountainous area. Recruits for the Lord’s army were often taken from surrounding villages and towns, more or less always willing volunteers. Unsurprisingly due to everyone living in such close range at Aqenlar it’s not odd to find one soldier or another bragging about how he has some of the bear’s blood in him. This is seen as a good thing to have, as the soldiers tend to admire (Or is it fear?) their lords.<br />
<br />
Nowadays Aqenlar is ruled by Lord Auberon Novum who is as loyal to the realm as the Novum’s always have been, they rarely see much of the dwarves or elves any more however and some say it is why Aqenlar itself is in such a weakened state. Perhaps in the future a Lord of Aqenlar will strive to strengthen relations once more, but only time will tell.<br />

<b>Miscellaneous Facts:</b><br />
<br />
Almost all of the Lord’s have some nickname associated with Bears, sometimes it’s simply ‘The Bear of Aqenlar’ other times such as in Rodmer’s case it takes on aspects of their physical appearance. ‘The One-Eyed<a href="" title="Create page: One-Eyed" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Bear’<br />
