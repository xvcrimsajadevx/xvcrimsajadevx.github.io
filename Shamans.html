Shamans are as powerful as <a title="wizards" href='wizards.html' class='wiki'>wizards</a>, but are considered by the Wizards as un-trained. They are of course trained by the existing Shaman, and therefore consider themselves more trained than the arrogant wizards. They are monk like, and very zen, and are very respected in <a title="Teran A'ao" href='Teran+A%27ao.html' class='wiki'>Teran A'ao</a>. Shamans are the magic users of Teran<a href="" title="Create page: Teran"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, they specialise in:<br />
<br />
<ul><li> Pyromancy
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul><li> Mind Magic
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul><li> Time Magic
</li></ul>
<br />
<ul><li> Elephâ€™s magic.
</li></ul>
<br />
They work with the Priests and Priestesses of <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. There is complete autonomy from those that serve in the temple but the Shaman do work closely with them. They are the corner stones of any village or Teran society and seen as the most wise and powerful of magic users by their own people. The servants of Eleph (the priests and priestesses) are powerful and they have special abilities given to them. They do not have to be born with the Ether ability in order to serve in the temple.<br />
<br />
The Shamans on the other hand are all inherently magical and teach each other the mysteries of their society. They often mediate alone in the desert and live alone in the societies throughout Teran A'ao, giving healing and wisdom to those who seek it. Those who train as Shamans (both male and female, all are equal in Teran A'ao) go into the A'ao desert where they are met by the Order of Shaman and are tested both spiritually and physically. Although they do not serve Eleph directly, they do worship her. They are above the temple servants, and seen by Eleph as a law unto themselves. Because they respect and worship her she grants them the freedom of their magics and personally taught the first of them powerful spells that have been handed down through the Order with each new generation of Shaman.<br />
<br />
Mysticism and foresight, time and explosive fire magics their strengths. Their weaknesses could be considered their refusal to share their knowledge with anyone they do not deem worthy. Also their refusal to entertain wizards, as they do not respect most of them and see them as foolish and arrogant.<br />
