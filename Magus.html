<a name='_b_Overview_of_the_Magus_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview of the Magus</b></h1>
<br />
The Magus are the close servants of Emperor Drakki of Eraosia and are all mind Sorcerers, otherwise known as Psionists. They were raised by him , they are his order and only he commands them.<br />
<br />
There are always seven, and like their leader, Drakki they always wear a mask, a different animal depending on their rank; the ranks are as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Draconian<br />
2. Falcon<br />
3. Wolf<br />
4. Sea creature (some believe to be the design of a fish, but it is impossible to tell what it is specifically due to the design of the mask)<br />
5. Wild feline (such creatures have become rare and so the name of the specific design is lost to most who have seen the mask)<br />
6. Centaur (though not considered and animal by most, the Drakki has this as an insult)<br />
7. Ram<br />
<br />
Magus are selected by Drakki only and they serve him implicitly. As no one knows the true identity of these Magus it is hard to tell if the same individual is always behind the mask. However Drakki knows the true identity of them all and if he decides to he will dispose of them and replace them. Some sorcerer's are earmarked for future Magus service and replace the deceased Magus and some Magus may be assassinated and their killer is sometimes employed as the new Magus if Drakki desires it.<br />
<br />
Their powers are all mind based even though they have to have previously trained in one of the schools of Lightsbane. All potential Magus and current Magus must have the Mind majick talent (often called Psionics). This is an Ether ability, and indeed one of the <a title="Talents" href='Talents.html' class='wiki'>Talents</a>. If they do not have this talent but are an exceptional individual or Drakki demands their service it has been known for a sorcerer to be 'granted' this ability upon ascension in the order of Magus. The higher the rank the more Mind Majicks and talents and psionic spells they have.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Psionics_b_'></a><h1><b>Psionics</b></h1>
<br />
Psionics is the study and/or practice of using the mind to induce  telepathy, telekinesis and other workings of the outside world through the psyche. The term &quot;psi&quot; means both extrasensory perception and psychokinesis. The most widely utilized psionic ability is telepathy, closely followed by telekinesis and precognition.<br />
<br />
The Magus also use this power to induce madness as a sort of overwhelming telepathy in the minds of those who Drakki wants to punish or who may be a threat to the emperor (or just because the Magus feel like it). Psionics is an advanced form of mind majicks and can only be used in this form by ether users.<br />
<br />
