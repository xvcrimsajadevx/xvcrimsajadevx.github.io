It is an unnatural formation, a ring of mountains with a black core. The edges of the abyss, in the plains between the edge and the foothills of the jagged mountains there are dragon skeletons littering the land. This is where the dark kindreds come to die and where a great battle of dragons took place. The Abyss itself is a black hole, and believed to be the foothold of the Darkness in this world. It is likely a portal leading to the place where only Thyrza can go.<br />
<br />
In the mountains are the aeries of the Eki tribe and upon the edges of this harsh landscape is the City of the Ny.<br />
