<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Apollyon has red orbs suspended inside a dark cowl, no determinable face or features. The eyes glow fiercely when he is emotional. He is always arrayed in dark robes, with necromantic symbols adorning them. His voice is deep and strong, and quite melodic actually. He is can lure someone into a false sense of security with his tone, and strike when they least expect it.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
 His temples are usually bare, made of black onyx stone and always located underground, his main temple of the Isles de Mortis being unique and the only exception. That is more like a fortress, a castle shrouded by mist and made of a dark greyish stone that seems to change its hue depending on sunlight.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
He has all the powers of necromancers plus infinitely more. As a Thyrza he has dominion over some of the Other Realms, the demon dimensions and particularly Oblivion. He is the Lord of the Dead and can steal souls and mark souls before the person has died. They become his slaves and are his creatures.<br />
<br />
As lord of the dead he has no fear, but he can be cautious and suspicious of the other Thyrza. He does not take their power lightly, and as is the nature of the Djinn, he becomes rather jealous of their position and power and does everything he can to consolidate.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Apollyon is worshipped as the guardian to the Underworld, but in truth he is a Minion of Darkness. Is temple is located on the Isle of Desdemona in the Necra Capital of Pand√¶monia. To reach his temple one has to cross the Lake of the Dead and travel with the <a title="Ferryman" href='Ferryman.html' class='wiki'>Ferryman</a>.<br />
<br />
As the curse came before the appearance of the Djinn and the Eria, death was already in the world... So when Apollyon came into the world death was what he had an affinity with and decided to represent.<br />
<br />
The vampyres were made before the Djinn too, and the Aluka never forgot this. They are the older race, even if the Djinn are more powerful then they, they are a race of the Darkness, not converts.<br />
<br />
Apollyon was neutral from the start, but also veering towards the Darkness very early on. He was quickly obsessed with Oblivion and wanted to control it for his own ends.<br />
<br />
The Isle de Mortis is the location of his people the <a title="Necra" href='Necra.html' class='wiki'>Necra</a>, the death worshippers and his temple. This race on these isles are unique, and a result of his 'experiments'. His main concern though is Oblivion, and the Other Worlds, and filling Oblivion.<br />
