<br />
Wreathed in fire as soon as she leaves the Quasi she often leaves a burn mark on the Quasi's chest. Humanoid in shape, her eyes are roaring embers, penetrating and commanding. Horns protrude from her head making him look rather demonic.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
She has complete affinity with fire and wields all the pyromantic majicks any wizard or sorcerer can, but she produces more fire, and her spells are at least ten times as powerful as any wizard. Only the Fire Magi can equal her, and her limitations in this world means she cannot stay around long enough to fight as the Quasi can rarely sustain her for long. The more powerful the spells she uses the shorter her duration in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Naolin has the power of the sun. A fire summon, she can perform a super nova. She is rather volatile and the Quasi who summons her can sometimes regret doing so.<br />
