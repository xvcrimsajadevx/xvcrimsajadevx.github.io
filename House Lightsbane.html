<a name='_b_General_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>General Information</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Alias </b>Inimicus~Lucis - Enemy of the Light<br />
<br />
<b>Race:</b> Human and Obsidian Elf<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Eraosia mainly, but they have secret clan houses all over Avalon and indeed, the world.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan</b>: The same as that of any sorcerer.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Their appearance varies. When in their clans houses they dress in black robes with the runes of their school of magic etched into them. Outside of their Clan Houses they blend in and appear as any human or elf. Sorcery is frowned upon in most countries and in Sedana you are put to death for it, so they are very skilled at blending in. In Eraosia they walk freely and can wear their black sorcery robes if they wish. Most members of Lightsbane though are not openly attached to the House unless they are members of the upper echelons of the hierarchy.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
Again, this varies, depending upon their school of sorcery. Most sorcerers tend to be very arrogant and sadistic, otherwise they would not deal in the black majicks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Lightsbane is an ancient House, its roots buried deep in Eraosia's history. Not a house of Nobility, even though it contains many nobles, but a house of Sorcery. There is much wealth in this house, due to the blackmailing, stealing, murdering, its hand in politics and its revenue from its misdeeds all over the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
On the surface it appears to be just another house, but in reality it is the face of sorcery to the world. It teaches sorcery, kidnaps children with the ability to use the ether and coerces and bribes wizards to join them. Many believe its Grand Masters to be the Dark Council, but again, in truth they are not. They are the heads of their schools, but the Dark Council;s identities remain secret. They neither confirm or deny their allegiance, leaving it open to conjecture and speculation.<br />
<br />
Even though people suspect Lightabane of amlicious deeds, their rank in wealth and history is too powerful to go against or deny. Using their influence in the Avalons society, as well as that of other races throughout the Nether Realm, they have made evil alliances with many prominent leaders in the past, all undercover and never openly acknowledged.<br />
<br />
Where Sorcery is outlawed or frowned upon they have secret houses where members can stay, and teach and convert. In Sedana sorcerers are treated the same as any magic user, yet Lightsbane still has a foothold in that country as well. Everything is concealed, and the members are cautious not to expose their secret houses to the authorities.<br />
<br />
Lightsbane has always sought total dominance for Sorcery in the Nether Realm but has never declared its intentions openly, always working in secret to influence leaders and society for their owns ends. Unlike Wizards, sorcerers work in secret, rarely revealing their allegiance. Working from the shadows and blackening mens hearts has always been a useful tool for them. Few of its members are known openly, the leader, his second and the Grand Masters do not hide.<br />
<br />
Once initiated a full member of the House, no member can discuss the House with anyone who is not a member. doing so results in death.<br />
<br />
Revealing the secrets of the House, and its evil plans will result in the hunting down and killing of the traitor. Only the highest members of Lightsbane know the identities of the Dark Council, and they have a spell on them that stops them revealing this truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h1><b>Magic</b></h1>
<br />
Magic is taught in Lightsbane in schools of Sorcery. There are seven and each has their own list of spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Necromancy_b_'></a><h2><b>Necromancy </b></h2>
<br />
Death Maijicks. Necromantic Enchantments - Only highly powerful Necromancers will ever be able to perform these spells as well as the death majicks, most learn either one or the other set of spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Alchemy_b_'></a><h2><b>Alchemy</b></h2>
the creation or alteration of raw materials<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Evocation_b_'></a><h2><b>Evocation</b></h2>
<br />
eradication or forceful removal of an object, be it inanimate or organic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Mirage_b_'></a><h2><b>Mirage</b></h2>
<br />
deception and bending reality<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Bewitchment_b_'></a><h2><b>Bewitchment</b></h2>
<br />
Spells that control people or objects. Strong minds are needed for this kind of magic, and often mind sorcerers are the one's who excel in this school of sorcery. Forcing your will upon the world is key to succeeding with these spells. This is the most innovative schools of sorcery as Bewitchers are always finding new ways to control, torture and have people to their bidding..<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Decimation_b_'></a><h2><b>Decimation</b></h2>
<br />
destroying/obliterating the target. Decimator's are the most insane and unpredictable of sorcerers. Wild, angry and often out of control, their spells are the most destructive and the one's to fear in a battle. Most who enter a fight with a Decimator, do not often defeat them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Transformation_b_'></a><h2><b>Transformation</b></h2>
<br />
manipulating an objects state/form<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Hierarchy_b_'></a><h1><b>Hierarchy</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
The leader of house Lightsbane is the Legatus Acerbus, he/she is referred to as this title rather then his birth name.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Head of House Lightsbane - Legatus Acerbus (Commander of the dark)</b><br />
<br />
The Head of Lightsbane is indeed a powerful sorcerer, but so much more then a figurehead. He/she is the public face of the Dark Council and of sorcery and many suspect as the Leader of Necromancy in the Dark Council and the leader of the dark Council. He/she does not take part in the day to day running of this huge organisation, but usually takes part in meetings between other high ranking leaders of houses and bands and conducts the business side of Lightsbane. Working their way into the nobles houses of Eraosia and maintaining an Alliance with Drakki is their main priority.<br />
<br />
<b>The 2nd in Command - Neco Dominus/Domina (lord/lady of death) </b><br />
<br />
The Lord or Lady of Death is a massive force behind this ancient name. They are the one who gets their hands dirty and keeps the members of Lightsbane in line, and makes sure everyone is doing as they should. The reputation of Lightsbane as an evil house of magic is maintained by the 2nd. Reporting to no one, and more of an equal with the Leader of Lightsbane, the second keeps tight strings attached to all the members, making sure they are not straying from the ideals of Lightsbane, and inflicts punishment to those who break the rules.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Grand_Masters_b_'></a><h1><b>The Grand Masters</b></h1>
<br />
Grand Masters are considered the best in their area in this House. They focus their life on their school of Sorcery. These Grand Masters are equally powerful in rank, but can be more powerful in their school of sorcery then the Legatus Acerbus and the Neco Dominus, only ambition and rank separates them from the leader and his second. And only because they choose it to be this way. It is quite possible that the leader of the Dark Council is a Grand Master... but none know for sure.<br />
<br />
The Leader and the Neco Dominus tend to be more all rounded sorcerers, not specialising in any school. The Grand Masters are the very best at their craft and none better them. There is much competition in House Lightsbane for power, and no-ones rank is safe as long as there is ambition and jealousy amongst the ranks. For its only takes an alliance of many to overpower one, so it is in these leaders best interests to not draw this envy upon themselves...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
The other occupation of Necromancers in House Lightsbane is to perfect the necromantic skill to raise corpses from the ground to create armies of Skeletons. One of the goals of House Lightsbane is to create an army so powerful, no one is the Nether Realm can challenge them. Those with a special talent in necromancy are desperately hunted and recruited.<br />
