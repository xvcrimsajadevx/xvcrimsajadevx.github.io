<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
Existence consists of many worlds. Some made by the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>, some the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, and some by the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> and <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. Only a few are listed here, but it is possible to role play in these realms, or create demons and creatures from them also. The Nether Realm is the last Realm of Light and where we base or plot, but these worlds will feature more and more as time goes on.<br />
<br />
To access these worlds one must have the ability to get there, or know where the portals are.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Shadow_Realm_b_'></a><h1><b>The Shadow Realm</b></h1>
<br />
This is the Realm of the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> and cannot be accessed by any other then that race. It is outside of Existence and time and space and is a bubble of the Ether. It is sealed off and only the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> can contact it and only the strongest <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> can push their way into the Other Realms.<br />
<br />
Very little is therefore known about the <a title="Shadow Realm" href='Shadow+Realm.html' class='wiki'>Shadow Realm</a>.<br />
<br />
Quinasar is the closest thing to a City in the Shadow Realm, if you could call it a city. The <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> do not build, everything in the <a title="Shadow Realm" href='Shadow+Realm.html' class='wiki'>Shadow Realm</a> simply &quot;is&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="simplebox"><br />
The Shadow Realm is not made by the Darkness nor the Light, yet most refer to The Shadow Realm as being one of the Other Worlds. As it has no place in the Universe but understand that this place is untouched by all but the Ether. It is a bubble in Existence and only penetrated by the Quasi, and only then in a type of Astral form (they must leave their bodies and travels through the Void in order to reach the home of the Eria.)<br />
<br />
The Eria are ethereal here and have no corporeal bodies. they have their own society and powers, the Shadow Realm has also bred new types of majicks never seen in the Nether Realm or any of All Worlds or the Other Worlds. This realm has a dreamlike quality, the Eria appear as apparitions, floating and sometimes even fighting. there are many Eria here who have never used the Quasi to manifest themselves in the Nether Realm. There is a faction of Eria who believe it is wrong to breach the Nether Realm, as the Shadow Realm is not a part of Existence, and by doing so they are upsetting the balance. The Djinn are their shadows, and by coming into contact with their world they are interfering with the equilibrium of both.<br />
<br />
That is the view of the majority of Eria, but Abeona lobbies her cause for her race to become a part of Existence, she was the first to learn how to use the Quasi as a conduit, and she has since gone on to discover other gateways. These are only one way and no other race can enter the Shadow Realm in corporeal form.<br />
<br />
The majicks of this realm are sometimes referred to as the Astral Majicks by the Quasi. Sometimes, when a particular Eria is feeling mischievous, shadow monsters breach the Nether Realm and cause havoc until found by an Eria and taken back to the Shadow Realm.<br />

<a name='_b_Oblivion_b_'></a><h1><b>Oblivion</b></h1>
<br />
Pathways of the dead.<br />
<br />
This is the world of the dead, where the dead are imprisoned and their souls wander in darkness. Every human soul is lost here. Only human souls dwell in <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>, because of the Curse they are doomed to wander Oblivion for eternity.<br />
<br />
Necromancers breach this realm by astral projecting and rip these souls from it to reanimate the dead. The souls are corrupted by their dark majick though and are tainted until they can be healed and restored to Oblivion by a wizard or another capable majick user.<br />
<br />
Wizards, particularly Divinators, draw these souls from the paths of the dead in <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> back into their dead bodies and heal the body the moment the soul touches it. This is better known as resurrection and can only be done by the most powerful of wizards. Some believe that the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Ezia" href='Ezia.html' class='wiki'>Ezia</a> was the first to learn this feat and teach it to the wizards. The soul must be returned to the body within two days or resurrection is almost impossible. Some say that there are only three wizards in the world who can heal a long dead body, and only seven who can perform the resurrection spell at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Daegrin_b_'></a><h1><b>Daegrin</b></h1>
<br />
The gateways to <a title="Daegrin" href='Daegrin.html' class='wiki'>Daegrin</a> can be found in the Wastelands<a href="" title="Create page: Wastelands"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the Mountains of Klineas<a href="" title="Create page: Mountains+of+Klineas"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
This is the Realm that the Shifters are believed to have come from. Very little is known about it and few have ever been there, or returned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Cheth_b_'></a><h1><b>Cheth</b></h1>
<br />
The Other World of Cheth is where many of the shadow creatures are spawned. A portal to Cheth is in <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>, on the edge of the <a title="Great Desert" href='Great+Desert.html' class='wiki'>Great Desert</a>, a place simply know as The Vortex.<br />
<br />
Cheth is a Hell Dimension, and demon realm and is likely the home of Shiloh<a href="" title="Create page: Shiloh"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The rak'Shual are bred here and humes and other races of the Nether Realm are imprisoned here too. They are tortured and often twisted. Cheth's atmosphere is putrid, fumes kill many within a few hours. It is a fiery plane with no sun, no moon and only a black, starless sky. Lava pits and volcanoes litter the devastating landscape, and fortresses are carved into the terrain.<br />
