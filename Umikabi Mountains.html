<br />
The tallest mountain range in the Nether Realm and the territory of the Everpeak Dragon Kindred. This mountain range starts near the northern edges of the Wastelands and lines the coast of the Eastern Continent, arching all the way east, branching into the land of the <a title="Centaurs" href='Centaurs.html' class='wiki'>Centaurs</a> in Terra. There is very little coastline in the north east of this continent, and where there are plains few inhabit them. There are no passes through these mountains, once you go in you cannot get out, only the Everpeaks can get you through this mountain range and they rarely grant anyone passage.<br />
