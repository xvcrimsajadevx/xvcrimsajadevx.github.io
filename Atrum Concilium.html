<a name='_b_Sorcerers_Domain_b_'></a><h1><b>Sorcerers Domain</b></h1>
<br />
The meeting place of the Dark Council is always changing to make sure the identity of the Dark Council stays secret.<br />
<br />
Even though the location changes, the look of the meeting never does. Conjured by the Leader of the Council, the Necromancer (as it is he/she who calls all meetings and summons the various members to the meeting place) the onyx table is always in the centre of a marble disc that hovers in the air. Darkness always shrouds this disc and the location of the meeting, even for its members is never known. The Throne-like seats of the members are identical, except for the seat of the head, the necromancer. Gilded with necromantic symbols, with skulls on the arms and spikes on the back of the seat, it stands out and sets the leader apart from the rest of the Dark Council.<br />
<br />
The leader is always the last to leave and destroys the meeting place when he goes, leaving no trace of the Council whatsoever.<br />

<br />
<div align="center">HEAD OF THE COUNCIL</div><br />
<br />
<b>Atean Shadowseer</b> - Necromancy<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>Athelwyn Waldrun</b> - Alchemy<br />
<br />
She is a sorcerer often found sniffing around the Dwarves, even though her own Alchemy is renowned in the Nether Realm. She has made some of the darkest weapons known in the Nether Realm and armour that defends against some of the most powerful Light forged weapons. Her amulets and trinkets are malicious and sadistic in nature, often a collaborate effort with Bewitchment Sorcerers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>Garwynn Estlufu</b> - Evokation<br />
<br />
Garwynn is an elusive women, very few ever know her location. Her age, her orgins, her plans are not even known to the Council. she never fails to turn up to a meeting, but never divulges any information. Her followers could be few or many. The only thing people know for sure is that she has THE most comprehensive black grimoire in her possession; and she is the most innovative sorcerer alive. The grimoire contains many of her own new spells.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>Edwig Stanathe</b>l - Mirage<br />
<br />
One of the most slippery of characters, Edwig is a snake and a traitor. A former noble of Adenia he betrayed his King, posing as a wizard and the Royal House was assassinated in one fell swoop as a result of his actions. The only civil war Adenia has ever had followed this tragedy, the fight for the throne a bloody one.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>Morathel Edest</b> - Bewitchment<br />
<br />
He is believed to have ties to House Lightsbane, known for his interest in recruiting new Sorcerers and having them specialise in Bewitchment, for the purpose of creating an army of Sorcerer's. He is also believed to have contacts in Sedana, something that is almost impossible for most magic users. As a former citizen od Sedana and having escaped being burnt at the stake, he bares a malevolent grudge against his native country and seeks its downfall and renewal under his sovereignty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>Bedos Lithere</b> - Decimation<br />
<br />
Some question his identity, most believing it is Furia in disguise, either way, nothing is known of this sorcerer. His powers are feared as his temper is as explosive as his magic's. Some believe Furia killed Bedos and took his place on the council, with the help of an unknown Bewitcher falsifying his appearance. However, there is no proof either way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>Yonard Lithere</b> - Transformation<br />
<br />
The name of Yonard Lithere is a new one, believed to be the brother of the deceased Bedos. The fact that he is still around means he was probably involved in his brothers death and formed some kind of Alliance with Furia. This is of course all conjecture. His powers are unrivalled and unique. Believed to be at least a half bred shifter many claim that Yonard can change into anything, and transform anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_of_the_Council_b_'></a><h1><b>History of the Council</b></h1>
<br />
The making of the Dark Council is shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The original members are not known, but it is thought that the head of the council was a Thyrza. After the Wizards established their numbers and expressed their desire to serve the Light and use the Ether to serve the Light, the Sorcerer's reacted by gathering their own numbers and forming their own council. The main difference being that the sorcerer's kept everything secret, nothing is known for sure about the origins of sorcery, except it was in direct opposition to the Wizards and their white magic's. All those who choose to serve the Darkness, human dark minions, seek out sorcery.<br />
<br />
In recent times the council is rumoured to be behind some of the worst atrocities in Avalon and a means for the Thyrza to work their evil deeds amongst the humans of this world. Their members are suspected but not confirmed, and their tenuous alliance with House Lightsbane is known to be under stress and pressure. The Council lead all sorcerers, trained or untrained, and represent all the area's of sorcery that shadow the schools of wizardry. The leader of this council is ALWAYS a necromancer; the current leader is suspected to be Atean Shadowseer, who is also the Grand Master of Sorcery in Lightsbane. Because of the stretched relations some believe that some members of Lightsbane want Atean's head, and do not want him in their house of Necromancy. If this is true one would think it was fear that motivated these proposals, as Shadowseer is not someone you would try and get rid of, especially if the rumours are true and he is the leader of the dark Council.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_House_Lightsbane_b_'></a><h1><b>House Lightsbane</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
Lightsbane is an ancient House, its roots buried deep in Eraosia's history. Not a house of Nobility, even though it contains many nobles, but a house of Sorcery. There is much wealth in this house, due to the blackmailing, stealing, murdering, its hand in politics and its revenue from its misdeeds all over the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
On the surface it appears to be just another house, but in reality it is the face of sorcery to the world. It teaches sorcery, kidnaps children with the ability to use the ether and coerces and bribes wizards to join them. Many believe its Grand Masters to be the Dark Council, but again, in truth they are not. They are the heads of their schools, but the Dark Council;s identities remain secret. They neither confirm or deny their allegiance, leaving it open to conjecture and speculation.<br />
<br />
Even though people suspect Lightsbane of malicious deeds, their rank in wealth and history is too powerful to go against or deny. Using their influence in the Avalons society, as well as that of other races throughout the Nether Realm, they have made evil alliances with many prominent leaders in the past, all undercover and never openly acknowledged.<br />
<br />
Where Sorcery is outlawed or frowned upon they have secret houses where members can stay, and teach and convert. In Sedana sorcerers are treated the same as any magic user, yet Lightsbane still has a foothold in that country as well. Everything is concealed, and the members are cautious not to expose their secret houses to the authorities.<br />
<br />
Lightsbane has always sought total dominance for Sorcery in the Nether Realm but has never declared its intentions openly, always working in secret to influence leaders and society for their owns ends. Unlike Wizards, sorcerers work in secret, rarely revealing their allegiance. Working from the shadows and blackening men's hearts has always been a useful tool for them. Few of its members are known openly, the leader, his second and the Grand Masters do not hide.<br />
<br />
Once initiated a full member of the House, no member can discuss the House with anyone who is not a member. doing so results in death.<br />
<br />
Revealing the secrets of the House, and its evil plans will result in the hunting down and killing of the traitor. Only the highest members of Lightsbane know the identities of the Dark Council, and they have a spell on them that stops them revealing this truth.<br />
<br />
The leader of house Lightsbane is the<b> Legatus Acerbus</b>, he/she is referred to as this title rather then his birth name.<br />
<br />
The Grand Masters are considered the best in their area in this House. They focus their life on their school of Sorcery. These Grand Masters are equally powerful in rank, but can be more powerful in their school of sorcery then the Legatus Acerbus and the Neco Dominus, only ambition and rank separates them from the leader and his second. And only because they choose it to be this way. It is quite possible that the leader of the Dark Council is a Grand Master... but none know for sure.<br />
<br />
The Leader and the Neco Dominus tend to be more all rounded sorcerers, not specialising in any school. The Grand Masters are the very best at their craft and none better them. There is much competition in House Lightsbane for power, and no-ones rank is safe as long as there is ambition and jealousy amongst the ranks. For its only takes an alliance of many to overpower one, so it is in these leaders best interests to not draw this envy upon themselves...<br />
