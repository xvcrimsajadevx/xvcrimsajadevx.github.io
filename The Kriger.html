<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Originated in Fenlar, along the Salieen river, but have since expanded all over the Fenlar region. Certain warrior fellowships inside the tribe, however, have become nomads, keeping peace wherever there journeys take them.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> The Kriger naturally live to around 80 or 90, sometimes even their early hundreds. But due to the nature of the race, they normally don't see past 40<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
 The Kriger are of immense size and strength. They are human, but their appearance often makes people wonder. The men usually grow to about 6'8 or 7', the woman usually range anywhere between 5'7-6'2. The majority of the race have blonde hair and blue eyes, but they are not only limited to this. The men usually have a very rough, chiselled face and the women tend to be some of the most beautiful in all of the land<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
 The Kriger are a warrior tribe, plain and simple. However, they are not as rash as they may appear. They are a generally calm race. Diligant workers and farmers, hunters, blacksmiths, and woodworkers make up a lot of the population. But the overall majority, are of course, warriors.<br />
<br />
<b>History:</b><br />
<br />
 Hundreds of years ago, the first Kriger settled in Fenlar. The exact origin of their ancestors, however, are unknown. The Salieen river served as their water source, thus providing them with the ability to sustain life. The first of the race, as far as we know, were hunters. But soon, due to their settlement location, they discovered how to farm and harvest. but about 200 years ago, war had reached across their land. The Kriger drew up arms and took on this new threat. In a matter of days, a small population of people had eliminated an entire army. With that, the elite warriors of the village packed up and left on a mission to defend their neighbours, thus beginning their nomadic tradition. Today, that tradition is carried on. Groups of warriors form fellowships, and set out, defending all they can<br />
