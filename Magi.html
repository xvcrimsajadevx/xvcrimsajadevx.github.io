<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> No one knows... as they are of the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>, one supposes they are immortal. The curse does not effect them though and no one knows how to kill them, if it can be done.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
They take on the form of their element. Depending on their affinity, age and character, their image may differ accordingly. Someone who is longing for their human<a href="" title="Create page: human"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> form will look more humanoid, whereas an old Magi and someone who has a very strong affinity may lose all sense of their former humanity and exist purely as the element itself.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Becoming_a_Magi_b_'></a><h2><b>Becoming a Magi</b></h2>
<br />
Through the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> all <a title="wizards" href='wizards.html' class='wiki'>wizards</a> and <a title="sorcerers" href='sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>sorcerers</a> can manipulate the elements. This by passes the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> and are very unstable spells. <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> and <a title="sorcerers" href='sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>sorcerers</a> who are consumed by these majicks become Magi - pure elements in human form. Part of the <a title="ether" href='ether.html' class='wiki'>ether</a>, they are the human embodiment of that element.<br />
<br />
To turn into a Magi a wizard/sorcerer must be adept in using elemental majicks. These are spells separate from the school they are trained in (necromancy/bewitchment/etc) and natural powers all Wizards/sorcerers have. How they use the elements is the same way they use the <a title="ether" href='ether.html' class='wiki'>ether</a>, they manipulate them. A race of the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> would connect to the Origin, <a title="dragons" href='dragons.html' class='wiki'>dragons</a> for instance, would channel <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>'s divinity/air element through them to control the weather, for example. They draw the element into themselves, and from the source, <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> to control it.<br />
<br />
Whereas a wizard using aeromancy would push and pull at the element, the world/air around them and force them to conform to his/her will. They manipulate the element, rather then channel it.<br />
<br />
When a wizard becomes a magi the wall between them and the element is breached, the element enters them and manipulates/changes them... makes them a part of the element itself. The only reason they are not destroyed is because of their connection to the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. They are as the origins are but instead of being the source of the element they are absorbed into it and flow as a part of it, they are made of it and it of them, transformed, every molecule of their human body morphed into fire or earth, air or water...<br />
<br />
A wizard/sorcerer may have been trying to control the weather, and lost control, got hit by lightening. The loss of control along with prolonged exposure to the elemental magic causes the change. Anyone not concentrating, not trained enough in using the ether, or at breaking point emotionally (i.e too angry, grieving, scared.) can cause this rupture and set of the chain reaction that turns them into a Magi.<br />
<br />
A wizard/sorcerer could be highly emotional at the time and fighting for their life... most Magi's were <a title="wizards" href='wizards.html' class='wiki'>wizards</a> or <a title="sorcerers" href='sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>sorcerers</a> who ended up using elemental magic as their main spells...most discard their schools and fight, study and play with the elements, they are obsessed with them and become addicted. As their addiction consumes them, in the end so does the element they have an affinity and skill with.<br />

<br />
Being consumed by the element changes their nature, their very form becomes as the element. Once they become Magi they are no longer <a title="wizards" href='wizards.html' class='wiki'>wizards</a> or <a title="sorcerers" href='sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>sorcerers</a>, or indeed, human<a href="" title="Create page: human"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />

<a name='_b_Earth_Magi_b_'></a><h1><b>Earth Magi</b></h1>
<br />
Earth magic’s wielded mainly by wizards, there are very few sorcerer’s who become an earth magi. Wizard’s who have an affinity with the earth are normally of a stubborn nature and fascinated with how the world works. Their delving into the mysteries of the world often results in frustration. Many are adept Alchemists too and friendly with dwarves and elves especially. Like the aeromancers, few become magi as the element is tough to master. You have to break through the bedrock and the stubborn earth to learn her mysteries and few have the patience or talent to do so. A great amount of control and skill is required to cause the earth to shake, and it can be at this point, when the wizard is poised between magic’s, that they may become Geo - Magi.<br />

<a name='_b_Water_Magi_b_'></a><h1><b>Water Magi</b></h1>
<br />
Calm, cool, and collected, Hydromancers tend to be the most fluid and adaptable of wizards and sorcerers. They are quick learners and often have an affinity with water because it reflects their personalities.<br />
<br />
For a wizard water is life, it nourishes and protects, it is flexible and can be ice, or steam or fluid. For a sorcerer it is death, it can drown, batter with its waves and be ice daggers and spears that pierce the heart. When a hydro-mancer becomes magi, it is usually because they are becoming as water, flowing between spells and constantly changing from one to the next. They are inconstant and soon find themselves consumed by the element they wield so fluidly.<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_Air_Magi_b_'></a><h1><b>Air Magi</b></h1>
<br />
Wizards who become air Magi's tend to be spiritual and connected with their deepest emotions. Only the deepest emotions can cause an aero-mancer to succumb to air, but it does happen. Their connection with the element of air is deeply profound and something they cannot understand themselves. Air is the hardest element to master and those that do tend to use it to control the weather more then anything. It is a difficult thing to do and requires much study and skill.<br />
<br />
Those who end up as Aero-Magi's either have a massive amount of control and aptitude for this element, or are deeply spiritual and lose themselves in it, desiring to become like a ghost, like the air and exist as a thought and a whisper only.<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_Fire_Magi_b_'></a><h1><b>Fire Magi</b></h1>
<br />
Typically the type of personalities that have an affinity with fire are the passionate and explosive people. People who are tempestuous and angry, who cannot control their emotions. Fire Magi's are the most common for this reason; most lose control of fire and are consumed by it, the type of people to lose control have an affinity with fire. Few Pyromancer's stay as pyromancers. They have to let go of the spells in order to stay as wizards or sorcerers. Fire is the hardest element to control as a wizard/sorcerer.<br />
