It is the grove the first elves woke up in and the Alumi Tree is the first thing they saw upon waking. The Grove has thousands of Alumi-Alania? Trees surrounding it. The miles of soft moss, fragrant flowers and grass are dotted with the pale white of the enchanting Alumi Blossoms. These blossoms possess mystic powers that not even the elves understand. Any race other then elves who touch the blossom either die upon contact or are cursed. The curse depends upon the person and manifests itself in different ways. It is impossible to walk in the grove and reach the Alumi Tree in the centre without touching these blossoms as the ground is coated with them and the petals are tossed on the wind.<br />

The Alumi Tree is the oldest tree in the world. It is the first thing that Titan grew and a gift he granted to the elves. To stand before it grants wisdom, and to touch it fills the soul with Light, life and rejuvenation. The tree itself is referred to in elven legend as The Tree of Life. Only the Alumi Guardians (who are generally Forest Elves who are called by the Tree at birth) know of its purpose, which is to house the souls of those elves who have faded from the world. The tree has roots deep in the earth and reaches to all parts of the Nether Realm. Each tree is connected to it, each rock and piece of earth is touched by Alumi and when an elf chooses to Fade, Alumi absorbs their soul. This is why an elf that is Fading seeks solitude and finds somewhere quiet. Where they end their days in this realm depends on their alamia. A forest elf will seek the trees, a mountain elf the white peaks of the cold mountain, an ice elf the frozen wastes. It does not matter where they go. Alumi will always find them.<br />
