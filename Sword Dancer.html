<b>Sword-Dancer:</b> A Sword- Dancer is basically a combination of a knight and an ether majick class, such as a wizard or sorcerer. Like any Ether user, a Sword- Dancer has prolonged life after being taught how to control the ageing process on the Isles. Usually, a Sword- Dancer starts training as a full wizard or sorcerer but quits for some reason and takes up a sword; rarely does someone starting training in majick with the expectation of becoming a Sword- Dancer. A Sword- Dancer can use majick from any school(s) of their choice depending on abilities and preference, though it is rare for even an experienced Sword- Dancer to master a school. Most Sword- Dancers leave the isles after learning the basics, take up a sword for whatever reason, and create their own spell to complement their sword style. Unlike wizards and sorcerers, Sword- Dancers do not carry a grimoire, but instead either go through extensive memorization training depending on the mastery of a spell or use alchemy to forge spells into their sword. Majick is done by a Sword- Dancer by a combination of hand gestures while holding a sword which includes position of hand(s) on the hilt and the swinging of the sword in various manners and incantations. There are two possible origins of the name Sword- Dancer: The hand gestures and swinging of the sword can appear to be dancing to some as it is more elegant than the average swordsman. Another possible explanation is that some believe that Ether &quot;dances&quot; around the sword and the caster in order to perform the majick with more ease.<br />

<b>Strengths:</b> The majority of a Sword- Dancer's strength comes into their versatility at using both a sword and majick, giving them an advantage over those that may specialize in only one. Generally, a Sword- Dancer has higher stamina than a wizard/sorcerer in spell casting because they are trained to withstand stamina from combat, which will also work with majick. Sword- Dancers are intellectual fighters as their abilities shine best while they produce strategies and many Sword- Dancers can take up military positions.<br />
<br />
<b>Weaknesses:</b> When it comes to majickal ability, a Sword- Dancer is not as strong with majick as their wizard/sorcerer counterparts and it is rare for a Sword- Dancer to master a school as they usually create their own spells from a variety of schools of their preference and master them individually. Also, without using any majick the average Sword- Dancer is not as physically strong as an average knight. In order to have free movement a Sword- Dancer wears light or no armor, so in the heat of battle they have little protection other than their majick.<br />
