GROUP/GUILD/CLAN/TRIBE NAME: Clan Diadami<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
LIFESPAN: Same as all OE's<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_APPEARANCE_b_'></a><h2><b>APPEARANCE</b>:</h2>
<br />
This clans sigil is the same as its always dominant house, Diadami. The black clenched fist holding a red lightning bolt (the sorcery symbol for Decimation) on a purple background. The purple denotes nobility, royalty, and matriarchy, the clenched fist representing the position of the clan as one of the 12 main clans of the Obsidian Elves.<br />
<br />
Clan and house Diadami are a matriarchal clan and are ruled by the female gender. They are a house of sorcery, experts at Decimation and highly chaotic, and their appearance reflects this. Aside from the tattoo of the clans sigil they have no uniform and no real cohesion, aside from the females wearing very little when it comes to Decimation robes and the men appearing downcast, the commoners not allowed to look upon or speak to females. They are so confident in their destructive spellcasting and their ability to attack they think not on defence and do not wear armour of any kind. The men dress in black robes and nothing more, the woman in purple sorceress' robes, bedecked in mithral enchanted jewellery. The higher ranking females in Clan Diadami have some thought on defence and their jewellery tends to be enchanted with defensive wards and protections against both physical and magical attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_PERSONALITY_TRAITS_b_'></a><h2><b>PERSONALITY TRAITS</b>:</h2>
<br />
The men of the nobility in this clan are treated like fodder if they have no aptitude for spellcasting. Warriors are considered second class citizens and no woman are allowed to use blades or weapons, even if they are poor in Decimation. Clan Diadami breed sadistic, malevolent, unhinged individuals but they come together for a common cause, to be the most powerful Obsidian Elf clan. The females use the men to practice their new magics, to send into battle first and as mates and lovers. They do not marry and they do not view males as their equals. Not even the talented males like Nim are considered anything other then good breeding and fodder in battle. The females are far more chaotic and sometimes out of control, fighting with one another as much as other clans. House Diadami have a little more control, and have done well to forge an alliance with Abraxis and his clan. This may on the surface seem to go against Diadami's traits but their ultimate goal is that of the darkness itself, Chaos, and they see themselves as Agents of Chaos and serving Abraxis briefly may aid them in this goal.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Diadami's Elder is still the ruling noble of this clan. Her whereabouts is hidden from enemies both within and without of the clan, but every clan outside of Diadami knows their Elder is still alive. When the clan was begun, when she arrived and mated upon the shores of Shadia, the tow Decimators mating creating a crater upon the beach, wherein a purple flame glowed. It is said that a fork of red lightning struck the pair as they climaxed, bringing forth the flame, and upon that ground the clan lands of Diadami spread. The flame is the life force of the Diadami Elder, and when she dies the flame will flicker out. To this day the flame still burns.<br />
<br />
Diadami are one of the few Obsidian Elf clans who reject any alliance with the dark kindreds and have a deep dislike for the Shadowind kindred. A battle between their Elder and Tiamat mars their history, as the dragon queen disabled the Elder and forced her into hiding. As Diadami also reject the death magics many clans see them as unusual, dangerous and unpredictable. Their use of Decimation has been perfected over the centuries and they are feared because of it. No other house or clan can rival their destructive spells and to battle Diadami is deemed suicidal. They are too numerous and to powerful, but also too chaotic to organise themselves to become more powerful or dominant. At least, that was the case until recently. The higher nobles of Diadami have become detached from their chaotic ways but retained their minds and destructive powers. Rumour has it they have been sponsored by Abraxis, that they have taken too much of their famous drug, or they have found a new way to suppress their innate fury and retain their fire power. either way, this is trouble for the other clans as a stable Diadami hierarchy and minds means a possible shake up in the power structure of their race. Diadami wants to fulfil its potential and dominate the Dark Continent, and with the shackles of their nature thrown off and their minds tamed, who will stand against their ascension to power, and who will stop Abraxis if they remain loyal to him and his clan?<br />
<br />
The clan are still ruled by their Elder, her first lover (who sired the heads of Diadami's houses) is still rumoured to be alive. The heads of the clan houses are the first children of the elder and any other children she has are all in House Diadami. Her children include Nim and Malvae, her youngest children and twins. There father is one of her many lovers, as only the heads of the houses were sired by the patriarch of this Clan.<br />

<br />
All the females are taught in the school of Decimation. The nobles of the clan, those belonging to House Diadami, are taught Decimation spells but the common Diadami males are trained as warriors.<br />
<br />
Unusually Diadami houses in this clan do not use death magic although they are taught the very basics when young.<br />
<br />
They temper their Decimation magics with a drug they call opiasia, a drug that dulls their mind and creates a channel between their conscience self and their magic and their inherent fury and chaos. The fury is dulled but it is still able to fuel their magic. The noble females take this often, but it is not a drug without side effects. In fact some believe it dulls the spirit to the extent that eventually the mind is lost forever. This is the weakness of Diadami and the reason they have never become the most powerful clan, their reliance on this drug has disadvantaged them over the centuries. It is believed a spell that creates a similar effect to the drug but does not have the drastic and debilitating side effects has been created by Malvae Diadami but before it is used en masse she must perfect it and test it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Miscellaneous_Facts_b_'></a><h1><b>Miscellaneous Facts</b>:</h1>
<br />
The drug - opiasia - is made by slaves in the clans lands of Diadami on Shadia. Its ingredients are a secret but one is believed to be dragon blood.<br />
<br />
The warriors of the common male contingent are actually very skilled with twin blades. They train in a secretive fighting style that combines their natural balance and innate speed with powerful finishing moves and blood letting slices.<br />
<br />
Although the male members of the clan are treated badly they are still rather strong willed and defiant. Many boys are murdered as babies and public executions are used to try and suppress the male defiance. the men may be more in control but they are still more chaotic then most other dark elves and find it hard to be subservient. the females enjoy putting them down and torturing them and do so often and publicly.<br />
<br />
The ruling house has always been the house of the same name, Diadami. This is because the Elder of the Clan still lives and rules.<br />
