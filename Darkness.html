<a name='_b_The_Darkness_of_Destruction_b_'></a><h1><b>The Darkness of Destruction</b></h1>
<br />
The Darkness was death, the Darkness was the beginning of all that is evil... the Darkness, the power of Destruction, the font of knowledge and hate and fear.<br />
<br />
The Darkness is winning.<br />
<br />
Still, the <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> elude the Minions, and hope remains.<br />
<br />
Their Light shines through all of existence, maintaining the balance of good and evil, of Order and Chaos... but one world still stands, the Nexus of All Worlds, the First, the Beginning, the centre of magic and Light, if that last world can be conquered then Chaos will rule Existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Darkness is the Primal Power of <a title="Death" href='Death.html' class='wiki'>Death</a>. It is a force, a power, but an intelligent force. Its only goal is to assimilate the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>, topple the grand balance of existence, and throw the Universes into Chaos. Here it would rule supreme, only Death and Destruction and Chaos would survive.<br />
<br />
It made the Hell Dimensions and tried to counteract every creation and positive step the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> took, opposing it in every way. When Men were made, it brought death into All Worlds, causing ripples through all of creation. Men's souls are claimed by the Darkness at the point of <a title="Death" href='Death.html' class='wiki'>Death</a>. The balance was shifting, there was no longer neutrality. The Darkness was consuming All Worlds, its curse of death reverberating through them, and its very Nature, all its power and malice were seeping into the souls of men, and elves and every race of all the worlds and planes of existence.<br />
<br />
For the first time ever, the Darkness was personified. Every world except one had been taken over by it and consumed by Darkness, all except the Nether Realm. Here it descended and now walks its lands. Known only as 'The Master', having 13 face and a voice that all could see in their dreams and Nightmares. The Minions are gathered here to strike down upon the Light and destroy its last Bastion in existence...<br />

<br />
--Can rip holes in reality into Other Worlds and All Worlds. The place where they tore reality becomes a Vortex. These Vortexes suck people into the Demon Dimensions. Some of the tears in reality are gateways to the Other Worlds and are maintained by the Thyrza.<br />
<br />
--They can also make demons, and summon demons from the Other Worlds.<br />
<br />
--They can sense <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> wherever they are in existence and hunt them.<br />
<br />
--They can communicate telepathically with any Minion.<br />
<br />
--They can warp to any area in the Nether Realm, but it is limited to one a day. Once they have warped to one place, they have to wait a full day before warping again.<br />

<br />
The Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are extremely hard to kill, and are themselves a part of the Master. They are the embodiment of the Darkness in All Worlds. They are individual souls and have autonomy, but they do the ultimate will of the Master. Each one is chosen for their abilities, any race can be chosen and twisted into a Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Their individual talents shape them in different ways, making them very different and useful tools for the Darkness. Their primary function is to destroy the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> from All Worlds. Most if not all of the Thyrza are in the Nether realm, as it is now the last bastion of All Worlds and the last Realm of Light.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Adair_b_'></a><h2><b>The Adair</b></h2>
<br />
Apprentices of the Thyrza.<br />
<br />
--They can summon dark creatures but not create them.<br />
<br />
--They can use the Shadow Powers, which include limited teleportation from shadow to shadow, and shadow fire.<br />
<br />
--They can communicate telepathically with any Minion.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Adair are the apprentices of the Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Nowhere near the power of the Thyrza, they could be one of many apprentices. It is not known how many Adair there are at present, and few are known openly, except for perhaps <a title="Ilshara Bladedancer" href='Ilshara+Bladedancer.html' class='wiki'>Ilshara Bladedancer</a> (Apprentice to Tiamat) and Jimor<a href="" title="Create page: Jimor"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Legion_of_Darkness_b_'></a><h2><b>The Legion of Darkness</b></h2>
<br />
All the other minions, the general followers, fall into the Legion. These agents have very basic powers, able to sense other Minions rather then communicate telepathically. They can fade into shadows, but not teleport via them, and they have some control over lesser dark beasts, but only if they are wearing the Ring of Suffering, which all Minions are given upon turning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Obsidian_Elves_b_'></a><h2><b>Obsidian Elves</b></h2>
<br />
These elves are very unique. They have all the Shadow Powers, and a very good mastery of telekinisis. All <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> are born with the ability to use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>, but cannot use Titan's majicks. They are elves in look and name only, cast off and cut of from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> altogether. They are masters of Necromancy, whatever school of Sorcery they choose ALL Obsidian Elves are made to master the Death Majicks<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Undead_b_'></a><h2><b>The Undead</b></h2>
<br />
Vampyres have only &quot;Shadow Powers&quot;. The Lamia's powers are stronger at night. but the Aluka can use their shadow powers any time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Races_of_the_Darkness_b_'></a><h2><b>Races of the Darkness</b></h2>
<br />
These include;<br />
<br />
<ul><ul><li><a title="Undead" href='Undead.html' class='wiki'>Undead</a>
</li><li><a title="Demons" href='Demons.html' class='wiki'>Demons</a>
</li><li><a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> - who are an adopted race of Darkness
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Shadow_Powers_b_'></a><h1><b>Shadow Powers</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<ul><ul><li>Teleportation from shadow to shadow (this ability can be interrupted if light dispels the shadow the minion is jumping too. Dismemberment and dissolving of the part of the body that is passing through and in the shadow that is spelled is most likely, and death if vital parts of the body or cut off or dissolved.)
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>Shadow fire (simply black fire that burns and poisons, in Shadowinds the fire freezes the subject with fear, tears flesh from bone if caught completely by a blast.)
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>Summon shadow creatures (these creatures are demons and shades from the demon realms and the Other Worlds. the nature of these creatures depends on what kind of minion summons them. It is open to interpretation.)
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>Summon/Conjure Darkness (Similar to the wizard/sorcerer spell Darkbringer. It literally means to conjure darkness and blot out light. The Darkness is sentient and infects, and for truly dark creatures, creatures and races of pure Darkness like the Aluka and Maliknine it differs slightly or expands to meaning summoning the chaos of the Darkness, not creatures, but chaos. This is coupled with blotting out the light of daytime and also interfering with Cleric's of the Light spells.
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
For weaker minions only the Darkbringer type of spell is what they may cast, but Aluka and Thyrza and high levels demons like the Maliknine can bring forth the essence of THE Darkness, Chaos and death. It is like a dark mist that infects people and destroys them.<br />
