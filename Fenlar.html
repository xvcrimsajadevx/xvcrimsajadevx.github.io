<br />
<b>Name:</b> Fenlar<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b><br />
<br />
Fenlar is in the centre of Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and on the land that was once a part of Gallian. The mountains of Gallian that stretch from the east to the west across the middle of Avalon are Fenlars natural borders with Teran A'oa, Sedana and Nyoryn. Fenlar's northern area's are mountinous regions, with foothills and valleys and rivers going into the deep south of the country. the north western border with <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a> is forest country and flatter until you get to the foothills south of the <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a> border. Fenlar is not a flat land, and where there are no mountains, there are hills, where there are no hills there are deep valleys. Forests cover the land and the natural features break it up into little hamlets overseen by Fenlar's nobles. In this time of peril only the larger towns and cities have survived the Bandit's. Most are under siege and at breaking point. All the main roads are patrolled by the bandits, and the Kings Men are too few to retake them. The dirt roads between villages are overgrown and fallen into disuse. It is a country of isolated communities, who have no choice but to gather together and abandon their homes.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns, cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Capital_Deliniad_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital - Deliniad</b></h2>
<br />
Located south of My Utinsa, and between the smaller mountains of Rensar and Etmir. The Plains of Seliani surround the capital, which is situated in the Delin Valley, between the two smaller peaks. The northern foothills are known as the Hills of Sorrow. A strange land that few venture into, rumours of ghosts and ghouls deter people from exploring it fully. The Mountain of Utinsa, the tallest mountain in Fenlar is the main landmark of this area. Its southern side can be seen clearly from Deliniad, and its northern side is clear from Nyoryn.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aqenlar_b_'></a><h2><b>Aqenlar</b></h2>
<br />
Near the Ter Mountain Pass, Aqenlar was the closest thing to a fort that Fenlar has come too. Built in the blocky way Fenlar tends to build its cities in, Aqenlar is situated against the wall of Mount Giul, and fortified with stone walls and watchtowers that are carved from the stone of the mountain. They use the mountain caves as barracks, making it the only city purely for the use of an army. For five years it has been poorly manned and is ripe for the taking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Sarinettii_b_'></a><h2><b>Sarinettii</b></h2>
<br />
A city that is the centre of trade for Fenlar, built in the valley of Ghen and a few miles south of the Rali Mountain Pass. Sarinetti is a more modern city in Fenlar and built with some of the skills of the <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a> from <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a>. It is both a jewel of the mountains and a fortified city, easy to defend then Deliniad but in a poorer position. It is the northernmost defence against an attack from the north and guards the only pass an army can use to get into the main part of the country.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Irenas_b_'></a><h2><b>Irenas</b></h2>
<br />
An isolated city, and although well populated, not very well guarded. This was the first city to fall to the bandits. Being on the border with <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> it has never been properly fortified as there has never been a threat from such a long standing ally. A wide spreading city, over the southern flats of the country, it can be seen on the southern horizon many miles north. Its main landmark it the Tower of Truth located in the very centre of the City. The city itself has seven circles, distinguished by small walls and decorative gates. The inner three circles hold the mansions of the nobles, the outer four, the main sections of the city, markets, entertainment districts and trade circle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Udenya_b_'></a><h2><b>Udenya</b></h2>
<br />
The northernmost town in Fenlar and the furthest place north people live in large numbers. Udenya is a troubled place, having been a part of <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a> and Fenlar over the years. The town itself is divided and no nobles claim it as theirs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lenyar_b_'></a><h2><b>Lenyar</b></h2>
<br />
An isolated town in the south east of Fenlar, it is a pleasant enough place, the former hamlet of Gwyndolin, the King's sister, and the birthplace of the King's heir, his nephew, Ryal.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dunae_der_Caen_b_'></a><h2><b>Dunae der Caen</b></h2>

<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
Fenlar is in peril. Fenlar has always been in peril. With its sister Gallian gone, it was a target for Sedana and Eraosia. Its rich lands, mountainous landscapes and mines in the mountains of Gallian make it a prime target. If not for the allegiance of Teran A'ao and Adenia, Fenlar would have been left to the wolves.<br />
<br />
Old King Palaar<a href="" title="Create page: Palaar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is alone. His nobles have been sent to preserve the other cities and he stands alone in Deliniad. Aid has come to disperse the bandits that have ravaged his country for the last few years, but there is more work to do. Dark powers are targeting Fenlar and all that stands between them and this beautiful humble land is their King.<br />
<br />
Fenlar is hill country, spreading out from the foot of the mountains of Gallian. The highways are in disrepair, the villages deserted and in ashes. The Kings Men are too few and the Bandits have been too many. Fenlar is at breaking point, but there is strength in this land still and in its people. The nobles have gathered the army and have secured the cities and towns. A time of peace is coming and a time of rebuilding. The bandits have disappeared and Fenlar's friends have answered his call. He does not have long, he can sense it, but he must discover the strength of Gallian before he departs this world, and Deliniad is the key to everything. Deliniad must hold, otherwise Fenlar will be no more, and the fate of Gallian with take her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_People_of_Fenlar_b_'></a><h1><b>The People of Fenlar:</b></h1>
<br />
Fenlarians tend to be a hardy people, strong willed and good hearted, like their king. They are farmers, millers, weavers and shepherd's, using the countries natural features to generate everything they need. They live in small communities, and even the cities have a sense of togetherness and camaraderie that is hard to manufacture. They are a simple people, feudal and happy to fish, sow and reap to keep their lives ticking over.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
King Palaar<a href="" title="Create page: Palaar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is an old and withered King, but a strong one at that. His palace is built into the mountainside, and is renowned as the strongest City in Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. It has never been taken by an enemy. It takes strength from the mountain, its walls built with the magic of the <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a>. He has no direct heir, only his nephew Ryal can claim the throne, who is the son of his murdered sister - Gwyndolin.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
A farming culture permeates Fenlar and they live by the will of the land. They are horse people, and live in vallies and hill regions, in forests and upon the river banks, there dwellings in harmony with the earth and living alongside nature and being dictated by it.<br />
<br />
There are people of the Light, and as descendants of Gallian they have the ancient relgion of that country. It is not an organised religion, as a lot of the traditions were lost with Gallian, but their faith is int he Light, and in creation, and they live by the standards of good and the teachings of the <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> of old. They value magic and send there people to the <a title="Wizarding Isles" href='Wizarding+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Wizarding Isles</a> to learn. They respect wizards and Fenlar is the home to many other religions, groups and peoples. They are a tolerant people, an accepting people, and always willing to help those in need.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
In a time of peace the laws of the land reflect their beliefs:<br />
No killing<br />
No stealing<br />
No worship of the dark gods<br />
Kindness to your neighbour and fellow man or being (all races are seen as equal)<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
In this time of war trade is at a standstill. The store houses are running low, the harvests have been poor and no food was coming into the country because the bandits were raiding the highways.<br />
<br />
In peace times the stores are filled and harvest is good. Trade between <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a>, <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a> and <a title="Teran A'ao" href='Teran+A%27ao.html' class='wiki'>Teran A'ao</a> has always been strong. Fenlar has fertile land and always reaps a good crop.<br />
