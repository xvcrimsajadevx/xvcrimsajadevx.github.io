<br />
 A City within a Labyrinth. Only the 'Chosen' can navigate the maze and reach the city in the centre of it. This city is the only place where there are structures in Terra, and it is believed to be the construction of Ancients who inhabited the land before the <a title="Centaurs" href='Centaurs.html' class='wiki'>Centaurs</a>. As only Centaurs are able to navigate the labyrinth they believe that they are the 'Chosen'. the buildings are not used as abodes by the centaurs but the largest is used as a temple of Titan. Here the centaurs congregate and are able to ask questions of the centaurs they have chosen to represent them to the Outsiders and the Gods. Ixion is that centaur at the moment.<br />
<br />
The Land of the Falls - This is the only notable landmark in a region that is thousands of miles across, apart from the mountain ranges and valleys of course. A huge valley which has a lake that is not much short of a sea when it comes to a body of water, in the middle of the valley and hundreds of large and small waterfalls flowing into it. Even though an underground river flows beneath this lake/sea the lake never ripples, the surface of the water never being disturbed even when you touch it or are submerged in it. The surrounding land is picturesque and a very tranquil place, with forests and glades covering the hills and flat land on the shores of the lake and filling the land in-between the sides of the valley and the waters edge. This is where many Seers can be found, a hallowed place where they come to read the stars...<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country:</b></h1>
<br />
Terra is not a land with a structured society. <a title="Centaurs" href='Centaurs.html' class='wiki'>Centaurs</a> roam, graze and mate, free to do as they please. They can sense any person who steps onto their precious land and gallop to greet them with spears and fury.<br />
<br />
Terra is a land of flats, plains, rolling hills and mountain ranges which are all unspoilt by civilisation and structure. Nature thrives here, and Terra is allowed to flourish under the care of its Centaurs. Few lands can compare to Terra's beauty, its grass lands, valleys, rivers and glades thrive and benefit from the Centaurs affinity with the earth. Their presence enhances the land and makes the trees grow strong and tall, and makes the grass green.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
There is no ruler of the centaurs as such. They select a representative who is charged with speaking to important people and speaking for the centaurs. This is Ixion at the moment, and is normally the head of the Knoss Herd. Each Herd is named after the lands they inhabit.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
Terra has no religion, but instead somewhat of a tribal culture. Each Herd has different laws and ideals. therefore, it is hard to know what each centaur believes about specific things. They all value the earth, however all believe in destiny and that through reading the stars they can know all things. Astronomy therefore is the closest thing to a universal religion and culture as in every herd there are Mystics and at least one Seer.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
The only law is that;<br />
<br />
Only Centaurs may tread upon Terra.<br />
<br />
<a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> are the only exception to this rule.<br />
<br />
Individual herds have their own codes of conduct, mating rituals and customs, but there is not a huge variation from Herd to Herd. Ixion does not make laws for the centaurs. Only Herd Chiefs can do that for their own Herd, so Ixion can only dictate to his own Herd (the Knoss) and to Outsiders.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
There is no trade and currency. Centaurs live off the land and are self sufficient.<br />
<br />
They have nothing to trade and even if they did, they would not trade with anyone.<br />
