<a name='_b_Titan_b_'></a><h1><b>Titan</b></h1>
<br />
Titan is the Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, or God, of the Earth and the creator of many races such as the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>, Unicorns<a href="" title="Create page: Unicorns"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and <a title="Centaurs" href='Centaurs.html' class='wiki'>Centaurs</a><br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
Titan appears as his element. Rarely coming forth into All Worlds, but existing in the Heart of Creation, when he does manifest himself in the Nether Realm it can be as a statue, as a mountain giant, he can be made of stone, or trees, or mud. Believe when I say you would know Titan if you saw him, his voice makes the earth quake and his eyes glow with the Light.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
The Heavens were filled with Light, the firmament sparkling with new born stars. The worlds of <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> full of Light, but nothing else. From this nothing Titan awakened, blinking in the new light, the 'day' he took the nothing and made the Rock of Ages, the first lands, the first mountains, the first beaches. Trees and flowers and grass and fields, Titan wove his powers and gave form to Creation.<br />
<br />
The Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> of Earth laboured tirelessly, weaving his powers through All Worlds, moving mountains and shaping continents. Finally, when all the work was done, he made life.<br />
<br />
<a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> woke up in the forests, on the mountains, in the groves and on the beaches. His first Children blinked as he had done, in the light of the suns of the Nether Realm. Other races he made, but none so wonderful as his <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a>. They were the First, and his immortal race, at least until the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> stole their <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>.<br />
<br />
Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, being the first continent he made, and the Birthplace of the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>, became their Haven. The Fading took their <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> from Existence, but he made Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> their Sanctuary, protecting them as well as he could from the curse the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> had laid upon them.<br />
<br />
But another fate befell his <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>. The <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> used his Earth Magics to create a twisted race, a dark race. Cutting them off made him weep, but they were lost before the first of them had breathed. He retreated into the Heart of All Worlds, leaving the Nether Realm to its fate. Until he was summoned by the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>, by his Child, his Orion<a href="" title="Create page: Orion"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, summoned back to the First World to fight for his children and the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>. To fight for Nature, for Earth, for Creation....<br />

<br />
Titan's powers can only be used by his races. Each spells strength depends upon the ability and knowledge of the caster. When the spells can be cast depends on what natural substances are available to the caster. I.e one cannot summon a sentinel if one is in the middle of the ocean. How these spells are cast also varies depending on the race of the caster. An elf<a href="" title="Create page: elf"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> may heal differently to a Centaur<a href="" title="Create page: Centaur"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and visa versa.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Heal_b_'></a><h2><b>Heal</b></h2>
<br />
 This is a primary spell of any race of Titan. The casting of it varies from race to race but the basic spell uses the earth to replenish and resuscitate the target of the caster, whether it be self or another. Whereas Nature's sacrifice drains the energy from a plant or tree to replenish lost energy a healing spell channels the life force of Nature itself and Titan to heal. Healing spells take more time and more energy from the healer. Generally used to heal others - this spell it difficult to perform on oneself and requires powerful casters to do so.<br />

<a name='_b_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Elves</b></h1>
<br />
Titan created the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>, and to them he gave his gifts of magic. Over time each alamia came to favour various spells and so taught each new generation to master these spells first and foremost. Each alamia chose five spells to base their magic teachings on. These spells have evolved as the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> have evolved and can be found on the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> page.<br />
