<b>History:</b><br />
<br />
The history of this guild has been a turbulent one. As the races have argued and wars have developed the links between the guild houses have been stretched. It is because of this guild that trade continues even in times of war, and most armies will allow their travel across borders as supplies need to get to their own troops as well. Recently it has begun trade with the Alatus in Volatilis, travelling there using griffins and some magic's available to them from the Wizarding contracts in the Wizarding Isles.<br />
<br />
<b>Magic:</b><br />
<br />
 Only magical items they trade really.<br />
