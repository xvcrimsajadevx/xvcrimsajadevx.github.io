<br />
<b>Name:</b> Isles of Lacanta<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> Over the huge expanse of the Ocean of Lania (with the eastern continent to the north, Stalicia and Tern to the south, and Lacatia to the west) these isles are scattered. The Lacanta Archipelago is a cluster of several island chains (which vary in land mass, some over 500 miles long - like Tern - some only 70 miles in diameter, like Ellinad). South of the huge land mass of the eastern continent is the land bridge of the Borea Peninsula, which stretches thousands of miles south and stops fifty miles from Stalacia, sealing off the eastern ocean.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_Islands_Cities_and_Regions_b_'></a><h1><b>Major Islands, Cities and Regions:</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Ellinad_b_'></a><h2><b>Ellinad</b></h2>
<br />
The centre of the <a title="Merchants Guild" href='Merchants+Guild.html' class='wiki'>Merchants Guild</a> and the hub of trade and activity in the Isles. Founded by the first members of the Merchants Guild. The island is located in the centre of the Lania Ocean and along the Acania Ridge. Was once an active volcanic isle<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Borea_Peninsula_b_'></a><h2><b>Borea Peninsula</b></h2>
<br />
South of the huge land mass that is the eastern Continent is the land bridge named the Borea Peninsula. It stretches thousands of miles to the south and stops 50 miles from Stalacia, sealing off the Eastern Ocean from Lania and the Lacanta Archipelago. The Gulf of Bor-Stala<a href="" title="Create page: Bor-Stala" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is the only thing separating the two land masses, and is a stormy stretch of water that few boats can traverse. Its violent storms are attributed to the different levels of the two oceans. Lania being peaceful is much lower then the stormy Eastern Oceans...<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Tern_b_'></a><h2><b>Tern</b></h2>
<br />
A huge island that is the size of a small continent lies in the south of the Ocean of Lania. Tern has smaller isles that are broken up between Tern's land mass and that of Stalicia and Lacatia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Stalicia_b_'></a><h2><b>Stalicia</b></h2>
<br />
Stalicia mimics the isles climate and topography but on a much grander scale. Jungles and tropical rainforests, with huge rivers and dramatic and beautiful landscapes make Stalicia an awesome land to behold. Stretching across the southern reaches of the Lania Ocean and bordering the Meridian, Stalicia has enclaves of settlements, even a few cities which make the most of the sunny climate and Trade Routes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lacatia_b_'></a><h2><b>Lacatia</b></h2>
<br />
A wild land and a hot and humid land where few settlers have lasted. Its close proximity to the <a title="Great Desert" href='Great+Desert.html' class='wiki'>Great Desert</a> has leant its climate to verge on desert as well. Hard pan deserts and canyons rather then dunes and sand storms, Lacatia is a huge mass of nothing that only the hardiest and most foolish of people live on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Titan_s_Cove_b_'></a><h2><b>Titan’s Cove</b></h2>
<br />
This is the most accessible and famous of elf Sanctuaries, located in the tropical climes of the Merchants Belt. Not a traditional harbour, the Rock of Ages is the smooth stone cove, a narrow inlet in the centre allowing passage into the estuary.<br />
<br />
Natural lands bridges attach the sheer wall of the cove to the mainland; stretching across the estuary to reach the city and towns around the harbour. There are five of these that connect the cove wall to the bedrock of the mainland, and this is all part of the Rock of Ages. The largest exposed Rock in the world the Cove is a magnificent sight and an awe inspiring one.<br />
<br />
This place is dominated by elves that use it as their main trade centre outside of Lenal. It is often visited by high councillors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
Most of the Lacanta Isles are volcanic islands and uninhabitable, but some which formed along the mid ocean ridge (which the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> call the Acania Ridge) are dead volcanic isles and are used by pirates (in the east) and the merchants (in the south and west). The larger land masses very in use. The more hot climates of Lacatia being populated by hardier and more violent types, whereas the tropics of Stalacia are populated by the merchants, retired folks from Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and even nobles. The cities here are in keeping with the relaxed climate and have huge trade routes that eventually cross the Archipelago and connect with the <a title="Great Desert" href='Great+Desert.html' class='wiki'>Great Desert</a> trade route and way stations, and the land of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a> and the northern regions of the great Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. These merchants maintain these routes and have established Stalacia as a haven for free trade and travel. It is very much a part of the merchant's Meridian, a store for goods and a place for the old merchant families to retire to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
Each region is run by its own sheriffs and law givers. Chiefs in some area's, mayors in others. Its a free land which is not under the rule of any particular country or race. The pirates bay in the east of the Lania Ocean are obviously a lot more out of control and dangerous then the more organised merchant area's<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
Depends on the region, race and country the inhabitants are a part of. Most cultures are mixed and there is a relaxed way of doing things, especially in Stalacia. Lacatia has a rougher culture where water is the thing of most value, and religions surrounding this need reflect this. Many obscure factions and groups live out here, and many strange religions are practised.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
Depends on the law enforcer and the region. Feel free to take liberties with these laws (or in other words, you are free to make up your own), as they differ so much from town to town and island to island.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
Merchants trade, Pirates and their smuggling, slave traders buying and selling people of all races and backgrounds. Again the currency also varies from town to town, island to island - depending on need, culture and availability.<br />
