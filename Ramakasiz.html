<br />
<b>Name:</b> Ramakasiz<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> The main Lamia city is called Ramakasiz. The City of the <a title="Undead" href='Undead.html' class='wiki'>Undead</a> is located in the northernmost valley of Aeternus Caliga. It is set within a valley, called the Valley of Kasi, with the mountains range of Rama either side of the valley. The great Northern Highway Road drops into the valley, and winds through the noble houses and estates within the Lamia<a href="" title="Create page: Lamia"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> valley and then up to the castle of the High Lord Osiri<a href="" title="Create page: Osiri"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The castle is atop the hill on the other side, and is built on the edge of the tall cliffs, the northern sea crashing its black waves against the castle walls. The stone of the mountains seal the valley, so only the gates, which are built into the stone allow passageway via the ground.<br />

<br />
Only the noble Lamia<a href="" title="Create page: Lamia"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> live here.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Wastes of Zircun" href='Wastes+of+Zircun.html' class='wiki'>Wastes of Zircun</a> are a scar on the land that only the most decrepit and feral souls inhabit. The foul aroma of the fell creatures are sometimes brought to the ears of the denizens of Ramakasiz when the wind was blowing in from the east. It is as if the black soil of this blasted earth senses the coming of something dreadful. The winds on the plains east of the City are often tempests. A precipice overlooks the one and only road that leads into the Lamia capital.<br />
<br />
The sun never rises in Aeternus Caliga<a href="" title="Create page: Aeternus+Caliga"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, no sunlight has ever touched the dark stones of the main road that weaves through the city to the great gates that keep out the commoners. This is the start of the Great Northern Highway, it begins in Ramakasiz and ends on the south coast of Aeternus Caliga. The last two gargoyles on this famous stretch of road sit like ancient sentries on either side of her. They tower as high as the walls of the city, their grotesque and twisted faces sensing vampiric blood and granting passage to it. These statues are imbued magically to detect any trace of the Light, and eradicate it with their stone stare. Lamia guards welcome them anyone not of noble blood and destroy them if they dare to enter the city further.<br />
<br />
The main thoroughfare of the City runs from the gates to the castle, going through the lower city and valley in which it is built upon, through the streets which house the lower noble Lamia. The dark stone buildings grow in stature as their owners grow in rank and the main road climbs the edges of the valley and creeps closer to the castle on the hill. The Lamia have mimicked the human style of architecture, such pathetic attempts to be like humans. Castles and palaces made with fluted columns and pillars and pointed roofs. The castle of the High Lord could be somewhere on Avalon, such is its design. The portcullis is emblazoned with Osiri's House sigil, and ancient symbol that not even the Lamia know the origins of.<br />
<br />
Dark paladins guard the gates and march as humans, look like humans guarding the inner courtyard of the castle.<br />

<br />
Ramakasiz is a jewel in the Lamia crown, the High Lord Osiri<a href="" title="Create page: Osiri"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and leader of the Lamia resides here, and  never stirs from his palace. The slaying of his wife and children had made Osiri paranoid, some had even said he was mad.<br />
<br />
The high nobles of the Lamia must obey the High Lord, but they often find ways around this. They with conspire and betray to get what they want, just like their human counterparts all over the world.<br />

<br />
The Lamia are a pure race of the darkness and worship it in their dark temples situated in the hills of the valley. Lamia priestesses oversee dark rituals that often involve the sacrifice of blood, both human and vampyre, and the sacrifice of maidens virtue.<br />

<br />
The Lamia Nobles have their own social rules, which change according to mood and whim.<br />
