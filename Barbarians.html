<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
The Barbarian Tribes are a sub species of hume (though it's rumoured some of the legendary heroes were part giant) that have evolved over the generations whilst living far from Avalon.<br />
<br />
<b>COUNTRY/REGION:</b> Nomadic, evolution occurring on the Eastern Continent. The largest Tribe, the Dragon's Cove tribe, are rooted to the feet of the Umikabi Mountains near the coastline of the Sea of Daerin.<br />
<br />
<b>LIFESPAN:</b> That of humans, though due to their rampant nature and hostile living environment very few live over 50<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
Many barbarians have dark hair, dark dusky brown eyes and deeply tanned golden skin. Some barbarians have red or light brown hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. Their exposure to various environments carve the features of barbarians and their cultures. 60 is considered old age and by then most barbarians would have thick, leathery, weather worn skin, the younger barbarians fresh faced, a spark of rage and spirit in their eyes. The average height of both male and female barbarians is about seven foot. Most tribes dress according to their environment, but most will dress in furs, leathers, and skins.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h1><b>Personality Traits</b></h1>
<br />
Proud traditionalists and a collectivist society they deeply respect nature, live alongside it and giving everything its place in the world. They tend to be suspicious about normal humes and detest their dirty cities. They do not trust them and until they proves to be honourable they are deemed lower then the lowest animal and plant. They have more of a dislike and distrust for majick, especially wizards and sorcerers. these kinds of majick users twist nature to perform their bidding and this goes against the statutes of their society. Any elemental majick users are put to death for corrupt the elements. If they abuse the element a tribe worships they are tortured first, for three days, then put to death in horrible and extremely painful ways. Females in the tribes are seen as second class citizens and are often made to cast their eyes to the ground and not look directly at a male. Any obstinate and disrespectful barbarian women are tortured and banished from the tribes and branded with the mark of an outsider.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
They formed as the remnants of a human tribe which had left Avalon to explore the world. The first barbarians discovered dragons and became obsessed with them, establishing themselves at the foothills of the mountains where dragons resided and idolized their seemingly invincible and powerful nature.<br />
<br />
The Dragon's Cove tribe became fascinated with dragons control of weather and rain danced (and still do) around their totem in honour of the power of their gods. Other tribes found a similar kind of worship for the other elements, the sea barbarians breaking away and becoming nomads on the inner sea of Daerin, mastering the water and building great ships. The earth barbarians made their home on the edges of the desert and in the wilds on the plains, their nomad villages consisting of tents and living alongside nature. The fire tribes made their home on the edge of the Wasteland in the plains of Fire where magma pits punctuated the land and infused the air with noxious fumes. These barbarians live on the edges of this land, sending those coming of age into the pits to complete their rites of passage. If they survive the fire they are adults and welcomed back into the tribes. If they do not return they are forgotten. The weak are not remembered or grieved.<br />
<br />
Most tribes have adhered to the goal of pillaging and hoarding treasure over the thousands of years since they evolved and split from the humes of Avalon. Being nomads for the most part and living on a continent where there is little civilisation they have become feared by the smaller hume outposts and villages. They steal beautiful women and wreak havoc wherever they go. They are not evil, just greedy.<br />
<br />
For the sea tribes the highest honour is to be one of the men chosen to run one of their few ships, travelling the world, pirating merchant ships and supplying their colony with their two main concerns (gold and women - neither last long in the male dominant society).<br />
<br />

<br />
Occasionally a person is born with elemental-based magical abilities is revered (quite hypocritical when one considers how they deem majickal humes, but they believe that barbarian elementalists are blessed and are allowed to use the elements because they have been chosen by their gods.). Otherwise it is a largely un-magical tribe, save when the occasional elf woman is forced to bear their children and small instances of power occur.<br />

<br />
Their founding father once said, concerning the mighty dragons they worship: &quot;We can't control the weather, so we'll rape and pillage instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are four main tribes of Barbarians, but many other smaller tribes. The main tribes each worship one of the four elements.<br />
<br />
The Barbarian's of Dragon's Cove worship Air and their totem is a dragon.<br />
<br />
The Barbarian's of the Blue Tide worship water and their totem is a sea creature that may or may not be real.<br />
<br />
The Barbarian's of Fire Mountain worship fire and their totem is a magma.<br />
<br />
The Barbarian's of the Wilds worship earth and their totem is a Tree Man (the desert faction have a Sand Wyrm as their totem).<br />
