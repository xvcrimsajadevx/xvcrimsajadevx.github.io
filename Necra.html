<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> <a title="Isles de Mortis" href='Isles+de+Mortis.html' class='wiki'>Isles de Mortis</a> (The Islands of Death)<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> The same as the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a>. The average age of death is around 80 years. No Vigil has ever lived beyond 90. Old age does not affect them until they exceed their seventieth year. They do not become frail in old age.<br />
<br />
<b>Religion:</b> They are Death Worshippers and the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> Apollyon is their God. Their rituals are strange and their beliefs similar to that of the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a>. They believe that a Necra's ilia (their life force) is recycled and they are reborn. At the point of Death Apollyon turns their souls into the bodies of a new born Necra baby. They do not keep their memories of these past lives but the most spiritual of the priests have been known to regress and recall some aspects of them.<br />
<br />
The Necra's always dress in black robes and wear skull masks during the day. Sunset marks the passing of souls into Oblivion the rise of the Moon is symbolic of rebirth. At night their masks come off ad they sing the Hymns of Passing all night. Necra's do not require a lot of sleep, but when they do it is always in the hours between dawn and midday. They replace their masks when the sun reaches its zenith. They are a spiritual people with extreme beliefs that fuel their society. They believe they are the Chosen, and that all souls belong to Apollyon. They serve him faithfully and without question. Whatever he, the Priests or the Keepers say they will obey and believe.<br />
<br />
Pandæmonia is the religious capital and there resides the Temple of their God. The Isle of Desdemona is a holy land. The Necropolis is where the Keepers dwell and they fear the Keepers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
This race are a pale race, their skin is so white they are sometimes mistaken as albino's. The reason for this is that during the day they cover themselves, dressing in black robes and wearing skull masks that obscure their faces. They vary in shape and stature, usually depending on the isle they grew up on. Those who become priests spend most of their time on Pandæmonia, and are slight, tall and hairless. Male and female Necra priest or priestess alike.<br />
<br />
The common Necra has very dark hair, very few are born fair, or with blue or green eyes. Most have dark, deep brown eye colours. Those who live on Kyoklys<a href="" title="Create page: Kyoklys"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> tend to be fairer, more tanned and less rigid in their style of dress and their rituals. As a Necra's appearance is not ravaged by age until they are past seventy the population appear to be in their twenties and thirties.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
Necra's are ritualistic and a very collectivist in nature (if a group of Necra's go hunting they share the kill, this society is not a meritocracy). The only kind of hierarchy in their society is a religious one. All common Necra's are equal, only the priesthood are elevated in status. Necra's are devout, narrow minded and very intolerant of others. Even those from other islands are not welcomed into the little communities. Childbirth is controlled, everything about their lives are controlled, and on some islands individualism is suppressed. At first glance they may appear a dull and dreary people, but once the sun goes down and their masks come off they become very tribal and excitable (for their standards anyway).<br />
<br />
The people of Kyoklys<a href="" title="Create page: Kyoklys"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are more relaxed. The Necra's here are still deeply religious, worshipping and respecting death, but not in a morbid manner. They are more sympathetic and more human then the rest of their people. It is rumoured that a faction of rebels operates here, hiding in its many sea coves and catacombs that spider like a web beneath the island. Insurgents are harboured and there is a deep mistrust between the people of Kyoklys<a href="" title="Create page: Kyoklys"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the rest of the Isles.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
The Necra's were made by the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> Apollyon, the same day the Eria Ta'Ko and Moriqueeta made the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a>. They are similar in many ways to the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> but have over the aeons evolved into a strange humanoid race. Their religion weighs heavily upon them and the mystery of their making and their supposed rebirth is shrouded in darkness.<br />
<br />
They keep no records themselves, the Keepers have their history locked away in Dis -the City of the Dead. They are not a people who live in the past and they have not changed their way of life since they were made. The cycle of life is unbreakable and their faith and devout beliefs keep it that way. Change is rare on the Isles and those who challenge it are either sacrificed to their God, or exiled.<br />

<br />
Common Necra's have no magic whatsoever. The priests are imbued with certain powers when they are ordained by the Keepers and Apollyon.<br />

<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info</b></h1>
<br />
The main city of the Necra's and is regarded as the second capital. Pandæmonia is seen as the religious capital, Lethe is the economic capital and where Necra's live mainly. More cosmopolitan and bustling then Pandæmonia, where the City of the Gods is subservient, docile and religious - Lethe is brimming with life, busy, but not over zealous. The Necra's are not exactly the life and soul of the party and their sense of humour is rather limited and their sense of fun very strange indeed.<br />
<br />
All Necra's must wear skull masks during the appointed times.<br />
<br />
Non Necra's and visitors to the Isles must paint their faces white.<br />
<br />
Crime is punished by banishment to the Marshes. The Keepers are the Judges and executors of the banishments. They escort offenders the Stygian.<br />
<br />
All must worship Apollyon. Those that do not will be sacrificed in his temple, their souls bound to the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>. (It is rumoured that the people of Kyoklys<a href="" title="Create page: Kyoklys"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> worship another <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, but even Apollyon has not been able to find evidence of this. This could be because they are under another's protection).<br />
<br />
Every seventh day every soul must throw a silver mark into the ocean for the Ferryman. As all islands have no village or town more then ten miles from the coast this is done without fail and is punished if it is not done.<br />
