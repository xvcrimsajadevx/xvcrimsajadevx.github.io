As they are a part of the bedrock of Lenal this is still considered Elvenhome. The terrain is something somewhere between that of Lenal and the Ice Continent, the climate lying within the cold belt; yet so far north is does not produce glaciers. Always covered in snow, the sun cannot melt it, even in the summer. The ice elves here rarely visit the mainland, the ice sheets that cover the Sama channel often making it impossible for ships to sail across. This, however, is not the only reason they do not visit. Most do not have the desire to, even if the ice did not stop them.<br />
<br />
These islands are mountainous, with snow covered valleys, frozen rivers and towns that are similar in design to Ardra. Not as hostile in appearance to the ice continent, yet still hard to traverse for anyone but the ice elves.<br />
There are no harbours; there is no capital, as they see Ardra as their true homeland. Why this alamia remain on these isles is a mystery as most, it seems, would prefer the colder climes of Ardra.<br />
