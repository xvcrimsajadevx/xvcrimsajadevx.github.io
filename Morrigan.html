<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Morrigan's appearance varies depending on her purpose in the world. Sometimes she appears as a raven or a crow, or a dark maiden, sometimes dressed in red and black armour, and sometimes in a black hooded cloak and black and red slashed dress. As a maiden she has black hair and very pale skin. Some have even mistaken her for a Vampyre, but here they are so very wrong. Her Djinn eyes 'glow' black. They are a swirling whirlpool of darkness, some say if you look into them, you see the Void where warriors souls are imprisoned.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
Her temples always look pristine white from the outside. Enormous edifices, with peculiar architecture that makes them stand out. The tall, thin spiralling towers twist at odd angles throughout. Inside are blood red drapes, and red tiles and velvet red carpets. The alter is always onyx stone, edged with huge rubies. The temples themselves are labyrinth's and easy to get lost in, sometimes forever. Time passes differently here.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Premonitions of a warrior's violent death, her presence often makes these self fulfilling prophecies. In ancient myth it is written that upon the death of 100 warriors Morrigan called forth the first of the Banshee, who, upon hearing of the death of their loved ones, the wives of and sweethearts of these warriors committed suicide. Morrigan summoned their souls to the sides of their men, and there they wailed. And continued to grief for eternity.<br />
<br />
Morrigan can change the tide of war, imbue people with fury and the battle fever. She does not kill needlessly, and is a fearsome warrior herself.<br />
<br />
Morrigan is the Queen of War, and appears as a raven preceding a major battle. This is believed to be the omen of impending doom. Her allegiance is not known, but many believe her residence is too close to the forgotten isles for there to be any doubt. Her followers tend to be miscreants, and fell beasts, as well as good, honest people. Her temples are all over the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
