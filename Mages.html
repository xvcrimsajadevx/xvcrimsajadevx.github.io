<a name='_b_Definition_and_Types_b_'></a><h1><b>Definition and Types</b></h1>
<br />
Mages are hume ether users who are the most versatile and unpredictable of all ether users. They are either self taught or have mentors, but are always individual with their spells and less formal in their spellcasting then the likes of a wizard or sorcerer.<br />
<br />
Neutrality is what mages are about, they hold to neither white or black majicks and are often used as mercenaries on ships and in armies.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Battlemages_b_'></a><h2><b>Battlemages</b></h2>
<br />
This type of mage not uncommon, along with various interesting and numerous other classes.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Elementals_b_'></a><h2><b>Elementals</b></h2>
<br />
Mages also splinter off into elemental mages and there are a fifth, sixth and seventh elemental group because of this. Elemental mages have a distinct advantage over elemental wizards in particular as they are free to explore their talent. Wizards are discouraged because of the fear of Magi but Mage's explore their talent and some seek to become Magi.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Water_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Water Mage</b></h3>
<br />
Proficient in water majicks and have the hydromancy talent. Calm, cool, collected is what describes water mages best. They are solitary types and quiet individuals and are sought after by <a title="The Children of the Waves" href='The+Children+of+the+Waves.html' class='wiki'>The Children of the Waves</a>. Becoming Magi is something many water mages seek. Most common in Adenia. Often employed on ships.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Air_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Air Mage</b></h3>
<br />
Proficient in air majicks and have the aeromancy talent. Air mages tend to be quite chaotic with other spells and not very focused. Any other spells are normally significantly weaker. Most common in Fenlar. Often sought after by ships captains to be employed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Earth_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Earth Mage</b></h3>
<br />
Proficient in earth majicks and have the geomancy talent. Earth Mages tend to be quite spiritual and commune with nature. They also tend to be talented healers. Most common in the Eastern Continent.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Fire_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Fire Mage</b></h3>
<br />
Proficient in fire majicks and have the pyromancy talent. Fire Mages are the most likely to become warmages or battlemages. They are the most chaotic, destructive and uncontrollable of mages. Most common in Eraosia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Arcane_Mage_b_'></a><h2><b>Arcane Mage</b></h2>
<br />
Specialises in the discovery on ancient spells and converting them to their own needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Three_New_Elements_b_'></a><h2><b>Three New Elements</b></h2>
<br />
Dark Mages, Light Mages and Spectral Mages all use the ether to mimic light, dark and the abilities and majick of the spectral plane. Spectral mages are the closest thing to a cross between a necromancer and a diviner.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dark_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Dark Mage</b></h3>
<br />
Dark mages mimics the shadow powers and use the ether to create dark based spells that are more commonly associated with Minions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Light_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Light Mage</b></h3>
<br />
Light mages mimic light powers like those of <a title="Clerics" href='Clerics.html' class='wiki'>Clerics</a>. They use the ether to create light based spells and are generally of a good persuasion and alignment.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Spectral_Mage_b_'></a><h3><b>Spectral Mage</b></h3>
<br />
As mentioned aboive, spectral mages give and take life and are a bit of an enigma especially for the Ferryman. Some may be true neutral, others either light or dark aligned and it therefore makes it impossible to tell if they are abusing souls or not. They are experts in souls and in taking and giving life and they have explored the mystery of the Spectral Plane. They are also one of the few types of majick users who can summon and use banshee.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: Mages spells and powers are open to interpretation, here is where you can invent spells and play with the set up of majick lore for wizards etc. Please be wanred though, mages spells are considered weaker on the whole but you are allowed more abilities and varied spells.<br />
<br />
Their abilities encompass all the ether <a title="Talents" href='Talents.html' class='wiki'>Talents</a> as well as all the schools of wizardry and sorcery. For most Mages they do not name which school they cast from or which they prefer and most have invented their own style. They may cast similar spells to a conjurer for instance, but they may also be a healer and an alchemist too. Their spells tend to be more chaotic and less powerful then wizards spells. They also cast differently and utilise the versatility of being a mage by casting in mixed and unique ways (not exactly rejecting the three forms of spell casting, they simply have their own way of doing things).<br />
<br />
There is no spell list, they invent things as they go and rarely have <a title="grimoires" href='grimoires.html' class='wiki'>grimoires</a>. They are simply free spirits, sometimes trained, sometimes self taught.<br />
<br />
Mages cannot completely stop their aging, but some have discovered how to alter their appearance and some can slow their ageing. They do not have the extremely long lives of wizards but they do live on average around 500 years.<br />
<br />
Mages are considered Wilders and can be trained in wizardry or sorcery at any time. Thye are sometimes trained by Shaman, druids or other groups as well. It is difficult to teach a mage in other ways of casting though as they have sometimes been casting for several centuries and find it difficult to adjust to new ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Strengths_and_Weaknesses_of_being_a_Mage_b_'></a><h1><b>Strengths and Weaknesses of being a Mage</b></h1>
<br />
Mages have their good and bad points, when compared to wizards, shaman, and other groups of majick users.<br />

<br />
<br />

</li></ul></ul>
<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_Ratio_of_Mages_b_'></a><h1><b>Ratio of Mages</b></h1>
<br />
One in fifty humes are born with the ether ability and of ether users one in five will be a mage. So for every 250 humes, five will have the ether ability, one will be a wizard/sorcerer and one will be a mage.<br />
