&quot;Tome of Necromancy&quot;<br />
<br />
Atean does not wear armour at all. The only weapon he deigns to carry is a dagger. If he gets close enough to use it, it heralds a painful death for his victim. It is a cursed blade, the edge serrated and woven with flecks of ebony in the silver blade. The script upon it is a necromantic spell, dooming the victim of its blade to raise from the dead a servant of Atean. The poison can be slow working or quick, depending on the will of Atean. Even a scratch from the cursed blade can render the wounded incapacitated, and caused extreme pain.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers &amp; Abilities:</b><br />
<br />
As Grand Master of Necromancy he is master of the Undead. He can raise an army of skeletons at his will. He can raise the dead, is a manner of speaking, they deteriorate and rot, and serve him only. His power over the souls of Oblivion is limited, and the souls of the races of the Origins are much harder to touch and control. He is working on necromantic spells to raise Dragons from the dead, so he can create an army of undead dragons that only he controls.<br />
<br />
His main power is Turning the Undead, which is tearing the soul from a human and leaving a hollow living corpse, aka a zombie. These zombies have a connection with their master and are controlled by him only. The spell he is most adept in is Mind Trap. He can enchant certain items, that can produce some small necromantic spells, but his true talent in this area lies in his ability to curse weapons. He has created blades that can, once a fatal blow has landed, turn the recipient into a zombie.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Atean is slim and tall, standing rigidly and somewhat condescendingly, around 6’8’’with constant shadows under his albino eyes. His stare is cold and contemptuous, a myriad of feelings evoked in the person unfortunate enough to have caught his attention. Long purple/green silken hair, held back from his gaunt face by only a thin black cord tied around his forehead and temples. His eyes are slightly titled, unnerving in their intensity, his face framed by his long eyebrows and delicate chin. His lips are dark and to some unlucky women, inviting. Broken promises and false hopes often pass those full, deceitful lips, luring the weak and sometimes the strong, coercing them into doing deeds they would never dream in their wildest nightmares they would do, if they had their own free will. Not all is enchantment though, some of it is Atean’s natural talent at convincing people black is white and the sky is down.<br />
<br />
His robes accentuate his muscular form, baring his chest, which has only four black straps with clasps down his right side. A tall collar that rises to about the height of the tips of his narrow, pointed ears is attached to his deep purple satin robes. A silver rope braided belt is taught across his hips, the tassels hanging loosely at his right side. On his left hip is a 12 inch sheath where he keeps his poisoned dagger. The tip of the hilt bears the crest the House of Lightsbane.<br />
<br />
His flared trousers are tight at the waist and wide at the ankle, where only the tip of his pointed boots can be seen. His robe is open down the front but flares out behind him like a cloak, and covers his arms, the sleeves flaring out at the wrists, hands adorned with magic rings on all his fingers. Woven into the robe or necromantic symbols of power. When he is at his strongest these symbols glow a deep red.<br />
<br />

<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Atean is a tainted soul, well suited to his study of sorcery, he was always going to venture into the taboo art of necromancy. As a child he developed a hateful gift of forcing his will on others, using it to get what he wanted. A dark minion by will and soul, he sought out the malevolent House Lightsbane in his native Eraosia and was taught by one of the most renowned sorcerers of his time. Atean had always displayed an aptitude for the arcane and learnt too quickly for his teacher to keep him in check.<br />
<br />
Atean practised his most sinister spells on others and grew more impatient and malicious year on year. Believing he was above those around him, despite being only a novice in Lightsbane, he treated them with contempt and disdain, deriding where he could and hexing and punishing those who dared to oppose him. Atean became obsessed with bettering himself and allying with the most powerful of nobility and sorcerers. He developed a talent for summoning the undead at a very early stage in his training and was quickly pushed into the school of Necromancy, so few had the talent for this branch of sorcery. His path was set at an early age and his madness began to spread.<br />
<br />
As he got older he changed and matured into a cold being.<br />
<br />
Atean is not vain, and does not appear arrogant. He is however, very confident and has every reason to be. He is a good looking man, and over six feet tall. He often uses his height to his advantage, using it to dominate people and tower over them, he likes to loom.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Backstory:</b><br />
<br />
Atean's past is as murky as his intentions. Few know about his beginnings. Born into nobility, his family are long dead and there are few who remember them. During his time with Lightsbane he has moved through the ranks, pushing himself and those around him to the limits. He is a well known sorcerer, and feared. He is only one of a few recognised as a sorcerer of Lightsbane, the tattoo of the House Crest on the back of his hand pronouncing his allegiance.<br />
<br />
After becoming a member of Lightsbane as a young man, he returned home to his families mansion, and killed each and every one of them. His parents, cousins, aunts, even the servants and the horses. Being the sole remaining member of his House he inherited all their wealth and the title of Lord. none challenged his claim, and none would dare touch the bloodstained gold of Shadowseer.<br />
<br />
Yet gold was not his goal, nor titles, or even power. Atean's motives were always venomous and secret. He keeps no one close, trusts no one, least of all his fellow sorcerer's and members of Lightsbane. some believe Atean to be the Leader of the Dark Circle, some believe him to be an Adair. But none dare name him as a Thyrza. He is shrouded in a millennium of mystery, a powerful figure in Eraosia, his plans are only now beginning to come to fruition. Some whisper of an Orb... a power that would grant him the ability to do the impossible; raise an Undead Army of Dragons...<br />
<br />
His protege in Lightsbane is Dakaxus Messor, a young and talented necromancer. His personal slave is Vesara, a woman he turned from banshee into human again because he desired her to be with him always. Some believe it was a reaction to losing his beloved, but he treats Vesara more as a pet then a lover. Her mind is his (something that could never be said of his beloved) and he compels her serve him against her will. Vesara has committed many horrific acts in his name...<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Information:</b><br />
<br />
Atean has a 16 year old daughter by Serenity. The girl's name is Ariana.<br />
