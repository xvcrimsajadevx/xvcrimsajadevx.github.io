Arcemedes is a master of Invokation – which is magic that invokes objects, a magic that allows you to call something to aid you. He can invoke objects that can then disappear and re-appear. The object needs to already exist in order for an Wizard of Invokation to invoke it. It is all about static movement, which is why Arcemedes can most often be found high in his tower . It is one of the most powerful forms of wizardry. Invokation also allows a wizard to create doorways, between realms, other places, and even the past. Time magic is a speciality of these wizards and Arcemedes is the master of them all.<br />
<br />
<b>Spells:</b><br />
<br />
Vanishing/Removal – can make people/objects disappear from this dimension.<br />
<br />
Vortex – opening a gateway to the demon dimension.<br />
<br />
Warping – opening a door to another location in the Nether Realm; only applies to the physical plane of existence.<br />
<br />
Wall - Creates a physical barrier using energy, and sometimes ripping trees and breaking rock to put a wall between the wizard and their enemy.<br />
<br />
Mind's Eye - Can invoke an object or even a person to appear, just by thinking about it, picturing it in the mind. Mind Wizards only.<br />
<br />
Omen – opening a window to the past or the future and sometimes the present to gain knowledge. This is Arcemedes' most powerful spell.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Although he is suspected to be a very, very old man, Arcemedes stopped his ageing in his late fifties. He has the typical appearance of an older male wizard, but tend to keep his hair and beard much shorter, having brown mixed with grey, and bushy eyebrows. His beard his manicured to a point, and his furrowed brow obscured by his sandy hair. His half moon spectacles are perched on the end of his nose, enlarging his deep brown, eyes which sparkle with intelligence, wisdom and knowledge. His robes are simple, light brown cottons and thicker velvet and suede's in the winter. His hands are calloused from all the writing he does, and ink stained from the quill he is almost always holding. His nails are normally ink stained too, and his dexterous fingers usually clutching a stereotypical pipe.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Arcemedes has over the years developed the ability to read and listen and partake in a conversation, and still know everything that is going on. He has a sharp mind, and is the master of multi-tasking. He has many assistants, his favourite being Isilyn, and needs them as he is always working and always writing his history books. A dedicated wizard and always looking for a new apprentice/assistant he is the mentor every young wizard dreams of. He is wise, he is understanding and he is talented in magic. His position on the council is something he sees more of an obligation then an active role, but he does use his influence occasionally (like when he is trying to get a good price on his pipe weed).<br />
<br />
A mysterious character, never truly revealing his thoughts or unveiling the purpose of his actions, he has a finger on the pulse of the world, and is using his ability as a master of time to try and influence the world in ways which most of us could only dream of...<br />
<br />
He is surprisingly very down to earth and realistic, and always alert. Even when he appears not to be listening he is filing away everything and his mind is always alive to any situation. He seems fairly passive, but he can defend himself in a battle more adequately then you would expect from looking at him. Do not judge a book by its cover, he has hidden depths and emotions and intentions that only he is privy too. A select few enter his true confidence and are bound to him as friends.<br />
<br />
<b>Backstory:</b><br />
<br />
The most renowned wizard in the entire Nether Realm. Historian, teacher, pioneer. Arcemedes is the only known wizard to have mastered the Tempora Grimoire, which contains the most powerful Invokation Time spells ever complied. It is believed that he can see the future, the past and events in the present, which explains the expanse of his Library. The most knowledgeable being in the Nether Realm (except for Eleph of course, which some believe he has contact with) you would be hard pressed to find a fact or subject Arcemedes is not an expert on. Always residing in his tower on the island of Caraes (KA-rees), he has many apprentices and assistants that gather information and pictures and artefacts for him all over the Nether Realm. Well connected and well versed in all languages and all cultures and peoples.<br />
<br />
His history is surprisingly blurry, as a watcher and writer of the history of the world his own origins have been lost in time. Some believe he was the first human t walk the earth, some believe he is from the future... some just accept him for what he appears to be, a historian. The truth may never be known, but what we do know is he has seen a future which he feels he needs to change. And his next apprentice is key to the fate of the world.<br />
