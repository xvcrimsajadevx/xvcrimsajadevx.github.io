<br />
Their description is vague, supposedly a seven foot tall knight in white armour which moves like a ghost and sometimes seems ethereal sometimes solid. They can move through solid matter like a ghost but they can cleave flesh asunder.<br />

<br />
Their main attack is the Eyes of Truth, a spell which compels all who look at them to see the truth of their soul. Minions burst into flame when this happens to them but creatures of the Light and loyal to it feel joy and safety and are escorted by the Knights into Yaquinta.<br />
<br />
Those who escape the Knights Eyes will not escape their sword as they can sense minions and target them and destroy them. The occasional good soul will come upon them and be compelled by the Eyes of Truth but most will pass through the mists of the borders of Yaquinta and find the Ivory tower and the villages of Yaquinta safely.<br />
