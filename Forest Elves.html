<a name='_b_Forest_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Forest Elves</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Region:</b> Any forest in the Nether Realm could be or is the home of a Forest Elf.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Normally blonde or red haired, slim, taller then most humans, and dressed in earthy coloured clothes (greens and browns and greys) the Forest Elves are the most human looking elves. They mostly have emerald green eyes, but there are a few who don't. They tend to be mixed blood elves, having only one parent who is a forest elf.<br />
<br />
Forest elves, as their name suggests, have a strong affinity with plants, trees and foliage. Their fashion reflect this passion by often wearing flowers in their red and golden tresses, living in the tree tops and going bare foot upon the moss and green grass of the forest floor. Forest elf women love trinkets shaped like the things they love; emerald rings and flower charm anklets being the most common. It is rare to see a female forest elf with braided or short hair as they prefer to let their hair hang loose, creating an enchanting aura that many men (both human and elf alike) have fallen in love with.<br />
<br />
Forest Elf males are as akin with the trees of the forests as their female counterparts. All elves are skilled archers but forest elves are renowned for being the best. The males are also sensitive to the health of the forest and to those around them, they dress almost identically to the women of this alamia; more often going topless, although it has been known for many a forest elf priestess to walk naked through the forests of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Forest elf ears are longer then most other alamia, and their eyebrows thin and long, their emerald eyes windows into all the forests of the earth. They are the spirit of the earth and epitomise everything good about nature, they truly are the the children of the earth Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Very friendly and very adventurous. The forest elves enjoy music and laughter, feasts and travels. They are the most numerous of elves and where there is a forest, you will most likely find forest elves. Some would say they are too trusting, too flighty, and far too inappropriate with their amorous advances, but this all can be overlooked as the forest elves have a real zest for life and live every day as if its their last. The more conservative forest elves are the Eldest, and they tend to be very philosophical and meditative. Nature is their home and Titan is their creator and they treat trees and flowers and plants with the highest of respect.<br />
<br />
They are so close to nature, and so in tune with it that it is a part of them. The younger forest elves are quick witted, adventurous and above all enjoy having a good time. They are skilled archers and have a warriors heart and courage underneath their fun exterior. The Wild Elves of Tragorian<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> typify the forest elf warrior, seeing danger quickly, and reacting even quicker.<br />
<br />
They understand death, and accept it. This is something every other alamia fears, but not the forest elf. It is the elves of this alamia that fade most often. Not because they give up, but they sense it is time for them to move on. Their love making also produces the most children amongst elves, but this is of course offset by the high number of Forest Elves who fade and die in battle. Those elves who leave Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> have a high percentage of Forest Elves amongst them. The forest elf desire to see the world and nurture it and their sense of adventure see a steady exodus from Elvenhome. The most notable of these is that of the two forest elf high Councilmen, Athros and Finril. They were not the first and will not be the last forest elves leaving Elvenhome in the search of adventure. And as a forest elf, they are most likely to find exactly what they are looking for...<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h2><b>History:</b></h2>
<br />
0E - The Making of the Elves<br />
<br />
- The Sundering of the Elves. Sub-races of elves were formed - these Alamia took on unique characteristics and traits depending on which part of nature they aligned themselves with. Some Alamia remain closer to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> than others, such as the Mountain and Forest elves whilst other such as the Ice elves segregated themselves completely from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
1E-The Darkness curses the elves with the Fading; they are no longer truly immortal.<br />
<br />
531E - The High Council of Elves is formed. The first meeting was in the Alumi Grove.<br />
<br />
-Athros Longbranch and Finril Táriël are chosen to travel to Vidonia to take their places on the Elven High Council as representatives of the Forest Elves.<br />
<br />
810E- Athros and Finril resign from the Council, and take a number of Forest Elves to <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>. They are replaced by Eldanár Súrion and Angaráto Séregon.<br />
<br />
811E- Athros and Finril establish Eladin<a href="" title="Create page: Eladin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which is built upon Sanctuary; the only known one on the Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
858E- Finril takes a small contingent of elves and establishes his own kingdom in Tragorian Forest<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian+Forest"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which lies in the North of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>. They become known as the Wild Elves. Relations remain strong between Athros and Finril, with Finril guarding the Northern frontier against the trolls and Athros sustaining the Wild Elves by extending a branch of Sanctuary to Tragorian.<br />
<br />
4900E- The Forest Elves take it upon themselves to seek aid from the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>. Emissaries are sent to Toah, Omri, Cephas and Morrigan. The Elves sent to Morrigan never returned. The answers from the other <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> is that they have no way of locating Orion.<br />

<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h2><b>Magic:</b></h2>
<br />
Five spells dominate the teachings of magic. These are:<br />
<br />
Elven Whisper:<br />
<br />
This is a form of telepathy that is exclusive only to forest elves. It can only be used between the same alamia. Outside of their race and alamia this whisper is more empathetic. Instead of clearly hearing the thoughts of another the forest elf can sense their feelings. They know if the person is scared, angry, and sometimes if they are being deceptive. It is a very basic ability, and can very often come and go.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nature's Friend:<br />
<br />
This is a telekinetic ability where the elf can manipulate his or her natural surroundings. In the cases of very experienced and wise forest elves they can encourage nature to grow and assist them. In its most basic form the elf is able to bend trees, float vines and use natural objects as projectiles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resplendence:<br />
<br />
Calling upon the Origin Titan, this spell is used to blind a foe. The Light of Creation shines through the environment and scorches the eyes of those who deem themselves enemies of Titan's beloved race.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Merging:<br />
<br />
Forest Elves do not have the ability to disappear, but they do have a spell that enables them to merge with their environment. The skin blends in with the shape and colours of whatever they are moving through, causing a chameleon kind of effect on the elf. This only works in forests, they cannot use this spell in any other environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nature's Tongue:<br />
<br />
Forest Elves are indeed the alamia that has the closest relationship with plants and animals. The spell Nature's Tongue enables them to speak to any animal. This is a variation of their telepathy and an animalistic telepathy. They speak the language of the animal in the animals mind and can understand a creature's verbal response. Some say that it is the elves who were the first race to speak with the Shual Wolves, an honour not even the ech'Lun can claim.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Other_b_'></a><h2><b>Other:</b></h2>
<br />
The forest Elves reside in the forests all over the Nether Realm. There are little differences between forest kingdoms, but generally these are the friendliest of elves.<br />
