<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> The Waters of the Nether Realm<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> As one of the first races, they can only be killed in battle or by the Curse of the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, which manifests itself as the Hecatomb<a href="" title="Create page: Hecatomb"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
The Azali skin shines with a dark blue and shimmering green glow, very faint, but in the darkness they glow like neon lights. Their eyes varying from completely black, to purple, yellow and red. Azaili do not have hair, but small flexible scales that the men pluck. These scales are segmented pieces that grow from their heads like human hair, usually very different colours from their skin. The scales have a shimmering look to them, glowing in the dark and very tough. The Azali women pluck and prune these scales into the various Azali fashions, or let them grow. Whereas the men tend to pluck them until they have a scalp covered in only the scales, no stray pieces sticking out giving their scalps a smooth, scaly look, standing out because of the contrast of colours between their skin and scale hair.<br />
<br />
Where human ears the Azail have flaps, ceranos, Azail call them, gills surface dwellers refer to them as. Azaili believe this is a very inaccurate description. Fish have gills, the Azail do not use their ceranos to breath under water. Their lungs can filter water and air equally, adjusting instantaneously.<br />
<br />
Their hands and feet are webbed, mouths wide and lips thin, and dark blue. Male Azaili are usually around 7’ tall, females around 6’5’’. They always dress in cotton robes, trousers, and wide fitting boots when surface bound. A simple white robe is used for swimming, made from a clinging, stretchy material that cannot get wet.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
Noble, diplomats, with beautiful cities underwater, and water temples on the shore. They wish to be a peaceful society and often act as mediators. They are brave and will resort to war only in protection of themselves, the Light, and Azure's races. The Azail rule the waters of the Nether Realm, and as victors of the Triad keep their prisons intact. They have a deep hatred for <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a>, and a personal vendetta against that particular Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Although because they have been burnt and left alone to defend against the Darkness in the past, they are quite cynical about associating with any race outside of the seas, afraid they will be left alone to fight. They are somewhat untrusting of other races, but not xenophobic. Their association with the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> had been cut off, despite attempts by <a title="Nado" href='Nado.html' class='wiki'>Nado</a> himself to repair relations. They are not quick to forgive or forget, and being such a kind hearted and peaceful race they sorrow at the loss of their friendship with the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a>.<br />

<br />
As the first race of <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a>, the Azail were given dominion over the seas. They were intelligent like her, and as calm as the oceans when content, but as fierce and destructive as a tidal wave when angry. Slow to anger though, with personalities like water itself, the Azail were loved among all the races, and by the other <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> too. They loved seeing the world and living amongst <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a> on the shores and visiting the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> in their aeries... but when the Hecatomb<a href="" title="Create page: Hecatomb"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> struck, this ended. The sea was the only place for them, only able to visit the land for short periods of time. But few risked it, and even fewer went far in land. The risk of getting caught on shore and dooming their race was too much.<br />
<br />
The Azail kept the waters safe, and made outposts all over the oceans, welcoming sailors and all races. <a title="Azaliz" href='Azaliz.html' class='wiki'>Azaliz</a> was one of the greatest cities ever built, and could harbour all races. But when the War of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> began the city above the waves was destroyed. After <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> was imprisoned, the Azail King and his wife sealing her prison with their blood, the new Azail Queen, (the daughter of the two who sacrificed themselves for the Nether Realm), hid Azailiz<a href="" title="Create page: Azailiz"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and the Water Gate<a href="" title="Create page: Water+Gate"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and made the Azail a forgotten people.<br />
<br />
For 1000 years they have not stirred as a force from their cities and outposts, only merchants going ashore, and the Kraken has not allowed anyone but those who possess the Ring of Allegiance<a href="" title="Create page: Ring+of+Allegiance"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> to get near <a title="Azaliz" href='Azaliz.html' class='wiki'>Azaliz</a> and the Queen.<br />

<a name='_b_The_Clans_b_'></a><h1><b>The Clans</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
For the most part all Azaili Clans stay together, and are Stewards of different areas of the waters of the Nether Realm. they keep track on who goes where, and only merchants with the Queens Seal can travel freely through the Empire, and even then these Azail must have special permission to go to certain area's.<br />
<br />
Evadne Clan - Reside in the Evadne Sea<br />
<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_The_Hecatomb_b_'></a><h1><b>The Hecatomb</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
All races of the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> are cursed with death. And even though the Azail are all but immortal, and will live forever if they are not killed in battle, they are cursed with the Hetacomb<a href="" title="Create page: Hetacomb"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Before the curse the Azail were able to live on land as well as underwater, and are still, even to this day, able to breath underwater as well as above. They have an inate desire to mix with the other races, to balance the world and wash away animosities. Their talents as diplomats is renowned. But the Hecatomb<a href="" title="Create page: Hecatomb"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> has put an end to this.<br />
<br />
If even one Azail stays away from water for too long, the entire race will die out. No one knows how this will manifest itself... But the first time they became aware of the curse, several clans were annihilated. They all returned to the water in time, and stopped the annihilation. It begins with the close family, then the Clan becomes ill and starts to drop. When these signs manifest a head count is done and an embassy sent ashore to hunt down the stray Azail and bring them back to water.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly no Azail can leave the water without permission form the Queen.<br />
