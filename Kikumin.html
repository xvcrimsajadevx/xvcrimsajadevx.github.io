<br />
<b>Name:</b> Kikumin (Kee-koo-min)<br />
<b>Plural:</b> Kikuma<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> The City of Tyaka, Mount Inioko, Eastern Continent<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> 200-250 years. Mature at 40.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Religion_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion</b>:</h1>
<br />
Worship spirits of both their ancestors (Kisu) and of nature (Kina), believing that these spirits provide both protection and guidance in times of need. As a result, Kikumin society is based around five castes, each of which is assigned to a certain type of Kisu. These groups are known as Oku, and are divided into the Fire caste (Kasi Oku), the Wind Caste (Sho Oku), the River Caste (Kasa Oku), the Earth Caste (Seki Oku) and the Spirit Caste (Kisu Oku). Born into these Castes, a Kikumin may not change which Caste they belong to. Although a Kikumin is free to take up any occupation they desire, many choose to take up a job aligned closely to their caste.<br />
Despite their castes, all Kikuma revere the spirits of the dead, especially of those from their own family, although only the members of the Spirit Caste devote all of their worship solely to the dead.<br />
<br />
Worship of the Kisu and Kina are not conducted in temples or by members of any clergy, but by each and every Kikumin. Each Kikumin has their own ritual of worship, and are all encouraged to worship the Kisu and Kina in their own way. Worship can take place at any time, in any place.<br />
<br />
Funerals of Kikumin dead are also dictated by Caste. A member of the fire caste is cremated, a member of the River Caste is set afloat in a funeral boat, buried at whichever spot they land. A member of the Air Caste is also cremated, but unlike the Fire Caste their ashes are scatted on the top tier of Tyaka. Members of the Earth Caste are simply buried, as are members of the Spirit Caste.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Roughly the same size and shape of humans, Kikuma are as a general rule much frailer due to their peaceful lifestyles as well as their genealogy. Their most distinguishing features are their skins, which can be either white or blue, as well as their eyes which lack any visible pupils and are a distinctive glowing red or blue.<br />
<br />
Just like hair and skin colour in the other races, skin, hair and eye colour seem to be determined by one’s parents. Hair colour can vary from white to black to dark blue, and in some rare cases even a chestnut brown.<br />
<br />
The glowing of a Kikumin’s eyes can give a hint at their health and vitality; a healthy, energetic Kikumin will have their eyes glow brighter, will illness or injury will cause their eyes to dimmen. Death will cause the glow to disappear completely, causing the Kikumin to use “Dimmen” as a euphemism for death.<br />
The “dimmening” of a family member or friend is a sad occasion, but also a dutiful one. Very little mourning takes place, instead the deceased is given a decent funeral adhering to the beliefs of their caste.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h1><b>Personality Traits:</b></h1>
<br />
Honour is one of the most important aspects of Kikumin life, a valuable commodity that is not used for social status; every member of the society is born equal and any can be elected to the City Council, but is instead used as an indication to others about how trustworthy or dependable another family is. A family that has very little honour will be shunned by others, discouraged from attending social gatherings and not approached in times of need, something honourable families do with each other without a single hesitation. Dishonourable actions include theft, bribery, murder, or even lying, resulting in Kikuma becoming shocked if witnessing such a thing happening in foreign lands. In order to achieve good standing with the other families of Tyaka, a dishonourable family must regain their honour by committing a noble deed, proving their allegiance to Tyaka or making a contribution to Kikumin-kind. In the past many Kikuma have been able to redeem their families with brilliant inventions or grand works of art, even erecting beautiful public buildings in an effort to become full, respected members of Kikumin society.<br />
<br />
Placing emphasis on beauty and harmony in virtually every aspect of their lives, The Kikuma believe in balance and the preservation of their lives and the world around them and constantly strive for further development of their City of Tyaka.<br />
<br />
The Kikuma are focused on their city of Tyaka, constantly engineering and adding to it in an effort to make their beloved city an even greater spectacle than concentrating on any expansionist plots. The Kikuma are not an Imperialist race, and have no desire to rule over others; their standing army has existed purely to protect Tyaka and its surrounding territories, and as a result has diminished in size and power. The best of Tyaka’s troops guard the outskirts, or serve as Elite guard in the town itself, particularly in the Council.<br />
<br />
Lovers of fine art and music; calligraphy, flower arrangement, tea ceremonies, painting, sculpting, writing and songs played on both instruments and with the Kikumin voice are exceedingly popular in Tyaka. Skill in any or more than one of these artforms is a sign of honour.<br />
<br />
Kikumin relationships may seem odd to some outsider, particularly those of the human cultures; arranged marriages are not uncommon, and by Kikumin standards a blossoming romance is characterised by gentle smiles and shared tea ceremonies, along with hands being held and soft glances exchanged. A relationship is often made with one “Life Partner”, also known as a Haiguusha. Although several lesser relationships may arise over the course of a marriage, a Kikumin will always remain faithful to their Haiguusha, a bond that will last for the entire lives of both involved. Divorces are almost unheard of, and are a source of untold amounts of dishonour.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b>:</h1>
<br />
Originally two different tribes, the white skinned and glowing blue eyed tribe of Nimumin and the larger blue skinned and red eyed tribe of Kikuta constantly warred over the territory that now contain the city of Tyaka, the base of Mount Inioko. The main reason for this conflict was a theological one; the ground was holy to both Tribes, and neither saw the prescence of the other tolerable.<br />
<br />
The Nimumin were spirit worshippers, able to call upon the ghosts of their ancestors for battle protection or to place curses upon their enemies, while the Kikuta were divided into the four elemental castes still in use today, although their manipulation of elemental energies was non-existent at this point. Dwelling within the mountains themselves, the Nimumin were a clan of mystics and mediums, using their own primitive magic against their Kikuta enemies. The Kikuta on the other hand outnumbered the Nimumin and were the first to develop what would become Kikumin society, utitilising weapons and tools to even the odds in the early Tribal wars.<br />
<br />
These wars lasted several centuries before a ceasefire was signed by Head Shaman Injikata of the Nimumin and King Iju of the Kikuta, both of whose statues can be seen outside the Council chambers of Tyaka’s top tier. The following century had both tribes slowly integrate, eventually having the small town of Tyaka develop at the foot of Mount Inioko. This town slowly grew, eventually gaining several tiers, each cut into the side of Mount Inioko, eventually becoming the capital of the Nimumin/Kikuta nation. Settlements outside of Tyaka eventually disappeared as the peoples of both tribes migrated to their new city, making themselves the people known today as the Kikuma. Although they have changed little genetically since those early tribal wars (the most notable change was those of Kikuta descent gaining glowing eyes and the ability to harness the elemental powers of their caste from the Nimumin, and the Nimumin growing physically in size and strength from breeding with the Kikuta). Today skin, hair or eye colour have little to do with heritage, both tribes have now completely merged into one.<br />
<br />
As with most nations, the Kikuma have had their own share of hardships to endure, including attacks by monsters, plagues, wars and civil unrest, usually concerning theological differences. The formation of the council, rather than the rule of two monarchs were introduced, with two members of each Caste elected to represent their respective Caste in council meetings. The Council ensures the smooth running of Tyaka, and although corruption has found its way in, to date the Council has remained largely uncorrupted, with all councillors taking their jobs extremely seriously, putting the welfare of the city at the top of their agenda as many of the Kikuma do.<br />
<br />
Today the civilisation of Tyaka has remained largely unchanged, life has gone on as it always have, with no interference with the outside world. Only in recent centuries have explorers of other races found their way to the City of Tyaka, providing the Kikumin with the first glimpses of a world beyond their own. Many of the travellers choose to stay in the city, adopted members of the culture that must nevertheless adhere to the Kikumin way of life. Even thought their influence on Kikumin society has been limited, it has stirred interest in the world beyond the forests and fields, causing some to leave in an effort to learn more about the world that the strange travellers spoke of.<br />
<br />
To date none of these travellers have returned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h1><b>Magic:</b></h1>
<br />
Majick is not practiced per se, but members of each caste can learn to manipulate the element to a certain degree. Members of the Spirit Caste can commune with the ghosts of their dead and manipulate the energies of life and death. However, no matter how much training their receive many Kikuma’s powers never reach the level of that of a Wizard or Sorcerer, and may amount to nothing more than the ability to get a fire going unaided, create gusts of wind or calm the flow of streams and rivers, and even these takes years of practice. In times of great need or strong emotions, these abilities are known to “spike” even in the untrained, but this itself is a rare event that chooses only to manifest itself in mortal duels and heroic last stands in the face of the enemy during a battle, and have been said to even prove fatal to those that experience them (To die in a “Blaze of Heaven” is one of the most honourable things a Kikumin can accomplish, but has become rare since the near-abandonment of the armies.)<br />
<br />
Powerful mages have been known to develop, but these come few and far between, causing many to forget that they ever even existed, dismissing them as stories made up to scare children.<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_1_Castes_of_the_Kikumin_b_'></a><h2><b>1: Castes of the Kikumin</b></h2>
<br />
<a name='_b_1_1_The_Fire_Caste_b_'></a><h3><b>1.1 The Fire Caste:</b></h3>
Worship the Kina of fire and industry. Popular occupations for members of the Kasi Oku include Smithies, Alchemists and Fire-fighters (a job that is taken very seriously, considering the amount of care given to Tyaka by its inhabitants). In the past, the Fire Caste was strongly associated with the military, but with the decline of Tyaka’s armies, the need for soldiers had severely diminished, especially with the role of the city’s defence taken up by the Earth Caste. As a result many members of the Fire Caste are unable to find occupations with a strong affinity to fire or industry, causing tensions to arise with the other castes, the Earth caste in particular.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_1_2_The_Wind_Caste_b_'></a><h3><b>1.2 The Wind Caste:</b></h3>
Worship the Kina of the Air’s domain, including the wind, thunder, lightning, clouds, travelling and stars. Popular occupations for members of the Sho Oku include: Astronomers, Falconers, Stablemasters, Architects, Explorers, Cartographers, Caravan Traders and musicians.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_1_3_The_River_Caste_b_'></a><h3><b>1.3 The River Caste:</b></h3>
Worship the Kina of the water’s domain, including rain, rivers, oceans and all life that dwells within them. By far the most popular job for members of the River Caste is that of a River Trader, ferrying goods up and down river to the Tyaka outskirts, although some also devote themselves to maintaining Tyaka’s water supply and aqueducts. It can also be noted that members of the River Caste make up the overwhelming majority of Tyaka’s artist population, creating great works of art and sculptures than can be seen throughout the city.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_1_4_The_Earth_Caste_b_'></a><h3><b>1.4 The Earth Caste:</b></h3>
Worship the Kina of the earth itself, including not only geological formations such as mountains and soil but also the majority of plant life and wildlife that depend upon the earth for sustenance. Since the decline of Tyaka’s armies, members of the Earth Caste have taken the role of defending Tyaka as the City Guard. Popular occupations for members of the Seki Oku include; Farmers, Woodcutters, Stonemasons, Carpenters, Builders, Hunters, Miners, and Geologists.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_1_5_The_Spirit_Caste_b_'></a><h3><b>1.5 The Spirit Caste:</b></h3>
Worship the spirits of the dead and the afterlife. There are very few occupations fitting for members of the Kisu Oku, but many choose to become scholars, librarians and philosophers although some have been known to take on the role of morticians and gravediggers.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_2_The_City_of_Tyaka_b_'></a><h2><b>2: The City of Tyaka</b></h2>
<br />
Built upon the solitary Mount Inioko, surrounded by stone walls hundreds of feet high and illuminated by countless fires and lanterns, Tyaka is a bustling metropolis, and the center of the Kikumin race. Situated between the Umikabi mountains and the Sea of Daerin, the City of Tyaka is the only civilisation for miles around, and is marked upon very few maps. In part due to its infrequent visitors, and also due to their reluctance to accept foreign ways of life, the culture of Tyaka has remained largely unchanged for thousands of years, its only notable changes being its increase in size and splendour over the years.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_2_1_Tyaka_Outskirts_b_'></a><h3><b>2.1 Tyaka Outskirts</b></h3>
The several miles of farmland that surround the city, several para-military groups guard these territories from attack, almost all of which are mounted divisions. Kikumin grow whichever crops they can in their fields, proving Tyaka with a diverse and nutritious supply of food that has lasted them for millennia.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_2_2_The_Lower_City_b_'></a><h3><b>2.2 The Lower City:</b></h3>
The city behind the walls, it receives very little sunlight and so is constantly lit by lantern light. The buildings here are mostly made of stone, as they act also as the foundations to some of the buildings higher up, several massive stone pillars that span the four tiers of the Lower City. serve as popular meeting points as landmarks. Home to Tyaka’s industries, this level runs deep into the mountain itself, which houses the great furnaces of Tyaka’s smithies and smelting works. Craftsmen of all kinds set up shop down here, however, making wares in order to sell to the River Traders or to have sold in the market above.<br />
<br />
It is also the lower tier that has Tyaka’s port. On ground level, the river runs in and out through the walls in specially created gates, the docks themselves safe within the city walls. When the city is threatened threatened, heavy portcullises deny access via the river. As the river is the main form of transport, only one gate allows travellers in that are travelling on the roads, which itself is equipped with a heavy gate.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_2_3_The_Market_Tier_b_'></a><h3><b>2.3 The Market Tier</b></h3>
The entire tier is dedicated to shops and stalls selling the wares of the goods produced in the Lower City, as well as food and goods brought in from the Outskirts. The Market Tier is also full of public spots, with public speaking areas, gardens, dojos, libraries, theatres for both drama and dance (Although Kikumin dance and drama seem to be the same thing), tea houses and massage parlours, not to mention a countless amount of other establishments. This is where the majority of business takes place in Tyaka.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_2_4_The_Earthly_Tier_b_'></a><h3><b>2.4 The Earthly Tier</b></h3>
Made up of five tiers, these tiers each contain nothing but housing, schools and facilities for Tyaka’s residents.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_2_5_The_Heavenly_Tier_b_'></a><h3><b>2.5 The Heavenly Tier</b></h3>
This tier is the smallest, top tier. Housing glorious gardens that are each dedicated to one of the five castes in a star formation, the middle of the gardens house the council chambers, an ancient wood and stone pagoda surrounded by murals and statues, continuously swept by the wind at such high altitudes, the view is breathtaking, looking far across the Kikumin lands. In these chambers the council meetings take place, governing the future of Tyaka and the Kikumin people.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_3_Naming_Conventions_b_'></a><h2><b>3: Naming Conventions</b></h2>
Names in Kikumin society are much different to those of other cultures, particularly in their practice of naming their weapons, and in insisting on a name to be used exclusively in prayer.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_3_1_Naming_Individuals_b_'></a><h3><b>3.1 Naming Individuals</b></h3>
Three names constitute a full Kikumin name, a given name, a Kisu or Kina name (depending on the Kikumin’s Caste), and a family name.<br />
<br />
A given name is a name chosen by the parents upon the child’s birth, and are the closest equivalent to “First names” in Kikumin culture. Given names are only used between friends and family; it is extremely rude when used by a stranger.<br />
<br />
A Kisu or Kina name is also chosen by the parents, but must somehow link the Kikumin permanently with their Caste. These names do not translate well into other cultures, but are nevertheless an important aspect of Kikumin culture; it is these names that Kikumin use to refer to themselves when in prayer. Examples include: Runs- With- Fire, Falls- Like- Rain, Dances - At - Night - With - Kisu, and Yields- Earth.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_3_2_Naming_Weapons_b_'></a><h3><b>3.2 Naming Weapons</b></h3>
Naturally, not all weapons are given names. Weapons are mass-produced for the militia of the city, and it is only custom- made weaponry made especially for warriors and adventurers that is christened a name. These names are very similar to the Kisu and Kina names of Kikuma, and are given to weapons in order to describe them in some way. Names of famous weapons are listed below:<br />
<br />
Sings - Like - River, One of the traditional swords given to councillors of the River Caste<br />
<br />
Gravel - On - Bones, a barbaric spiked club belonging to an ancient hero from the Nimumin- Kakuta tribal wars.<br />
<br />
Dances - Under - Unrelenting - Stone, Ceremonial dagger belonging to the councillors of the Spirit Caste.<br />
