<br />
Lord Abraxis is rarely seen and his appearance is often debated. Some insist that he looks Obsidian, that he wears black armour with the sigul of a red eye painted upon his breast plate. His skin is jet, and his long hair is streaked silver and white. His unusual eyes are slitted like that of a serpent, and as wholly black as the Chasm of Gad (which lyeth in the centre of the Dark Continents forbidden wastes). His hands are like claws beneath his gauntlets and his smile both terrible and bewitching. He is believed to be seven foot tall and bears a great sword (which some call Nemesis) that rests upon his knees when he sits upon his obsidian throne in his tower.<br />
<br />
Others believe he is a shadow and a nightmare, not elf, nor hume, but beast. His eyes are crimson orbs and his shape obscured by a foul, black mist which light cannot penetrate. The red eyes hover, searing through the fog and turning all who look upon them to stone.<br />
<br />
Whatever his appearence he never stirs from his tower (at least he has never been seen leaving) and those who go before him never speak of their ordeal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Abraxis is an enigma. Some call him Tyrant, some Diplomat, some Usurper. There are few in his circle, and even fewer whom he trusts. It is unknown why he suspects treachery from all quarters, but many believe he has ways and means of discovering such betrayal, and so they rarely attempt it. How he uncovers their darkest of secrets is disturbing and some, as a result of this seeming omniscience, believe him a God. This may be propaganda, tales spun to obscure his Achilles heel, his limits in power, but there is no way to be sure of this.<br />
<br />
It is rumoured he has a foul temper and has in the past massacred the twelve Obsidian's Generals during a particularly bloody audience with him. Since that day the Generals of the Clans refuse to congregate at once before him. Abraxis could force them to come before him but he reneges as he likes to keep them on their toes and apprehensive and in fear. His moods are known to often shift and falter, and so his demands can never be assuaged.<br />

<br />
No one can recall when Abraxis took power. Not even the Elders. A shroud of forgetfulness obscures their memory/mind, and this fog thickens the more they try to think upon it.<br />
<br />
It is widely believed that he made the Onyx Tower, that he is the Tower and is bound to it. It is an alien structure upon the isles and upon the dark continent, and like the arrival of Abraxis, its construction is shrouded in mystery. Some believe they remember it rising up through the black earth. and civilisation being built up around it. Some believe it was there before even the Elders arrived.<br />
<br />
Either way his past is like him, an enigma.<br />
