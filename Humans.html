Not inherently majickal humes are sometimes born with the ability to use the Ether, one of the four Primal Powers. About 1/100 out of the entire hume population have the Ether Ability and out of those only 1/20 ether users have special Talents (like elemental prowess, Seership, etc). The wizarding isles is only one fifth wizard, the other four fifths are normal humes working on the isles. The rate of humans being born with the ether ability is also in decline, having dropped from 1/50 to 1/100 in the last fifty years.<br />

Each culture have varied traits, beliefs, appearance, fashion and for a more in depth look at human cultures and this race go to <a title="Regions" href='Regions.html' class='wiki'>Regions</a> (such as Avalon, <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>, the Ice Continent, the Wizarding Ilse's as they all have hume populations for the most part but there are outposts and city states all over the Nether Realm as well that harbour hume culture - such as Cendes and Glacius Regnum). The level of technology is that of medieval Europe and feudal Persia and Japan, but for specific information we suggest you search the cultures of the peoples of the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
There is a Common Tongue a language spoken by all. Hume literacy is low and there is variation between cultures when it comes to runes and script. The written word may differ but spoken language is the same for all humes, and indeed most races. Cultures and races may have certain words for specific things that differ from nation to nation and race to race.<br />
