<b>RACE CREATION IS LIMITED AND YOU MUST BE AN EXISTING AND ACTIVE MEMBER IN ORDER TO SUBMIT A RACE. ONLY RACES THAT ARE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT NR ALREADY HAS WILL BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED. THANK YOU</b><br />
<br />
If you decide to create a race for the Nether Realm, and then get it accepted I have a policy of modding the creators for the relevant forums. I do this for a couple of reasons. The main one is so all questions from members can go your way - they are not my race after all. And secondly, because I do not want the responsibility of looking after a race I did not create. You will be responsible for that race.<br />
<br />
Not only am I harsh when critiquing these races, there is also a responsibility involved, which I expect to be honoured. If you decide to take this on then I ask that you plan on staying around. Go away for too long and the race may be retired and moved to the archives.<br />
<br />
<br />
Copy and Paste the Race Creation Template and post the application in this forum.<br />
