The Eria <a title="Abeona" href='Abeona.html' class='wiki'>Abeona</a> chose a human magic user to be the first to touch the <a title="Shadow Realm" href='Shadow+Realm.html' class='wiki'>Shadow Realm</a>. From that day forward <a title="Summoners" href='Summoners.html' class='wiki'>Summoners</a> were born and some were made, the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> vowing to aid their people, whom they called the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a>.<br />
<br />
The people of the Eria gathered from all over the Nether Realm to the hallowed island of Aether<a href="" title="Create page: Aether"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The city of Jalina rose up and the temple of Gates was built in honoured of the Eria, the Gods of the Quasi Humans. In 225E the mysterious race of the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> came to Aether, tied to the Erias Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Ta'Ko<a href="" title="Create page: Ta%27Ko"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Their creator was not known, but these people were not human, even though they looked like humans. The Vigilia enter into an oath with the Quasi, vowing to protect them. The warrior race had mysterious beginnings and even though they are close with the Quasi, even they Quasi do not know their true origins.<br />
<br />
Both races inhabited the island of Aether, the Quasi practising their summoning and dedicating themselves to the Eria and the Vigilia ever vigilant, ever watchful. The Quasi strived to summon new Eria. Always trying to reach the Shadow Realm, some even trying to cross into it themselves the Quasi brought all who wished to become summoners and adopted them into their tribes. Sought by Wizards as well as Minions, Aether had a spell cast over it by Zaci, to hide the island from all but summoners.<br />
<br />
In 5600E the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> launched an attack on Aether. The battle raged for three days, it was a blood bath on both sides, indeed the ocean ran red with it. How the Minions found Aether was a mystery none would solve for many hundreds of years. It did not matter. Aether was utterly destroyed, the island saved by one final summon by the High Summoner Latanya. <a title="Elysia" href='Elysia.html' class='wiki'>Elysia</a> was able to save the land but not the people. The survivors left Aether, with a promise to return to her before the Last Battle. The secrets of Aether are still protected by the Quasi, who return there every so often to check on them.<br />
<br />
The Quasi become a nomadic people, splitting into tribes to hide their true number. Each tribe is lead by an Elder, and each Elder holds a piece of the puzzle that unlocks the secrets of their ancient people and the secrets of the Eria and the Shadow Realm.<br />
<br />
It is thought that the Quasi, for their bravery and sacrifice, were taught by Abeona how to teleport themselves. Those summoners who are not born into a Quasi tribe have the innate ability to find their way to their ancient home. Once there they have to negotiate the trials of the temple and enter the portals that lead to the places where they are taught to summon each Eria.<br />
<br />
The Quasi believe that one day their people will be reunited in Aether, summoned by the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> they will be at the Last Battle. They believe they must be there to summon the Eria against the Djinn (so the Quasi believe, not the Eria though). Prophecy tells them the Djinn will be on the side of Darkness, upsetting the balance of All Worlds, so therefore the Eria must fight for the Light to keep All Worlds neutral and balance intact.<br />
