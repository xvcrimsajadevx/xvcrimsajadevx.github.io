<a name='_b_Necromancy_b_'></a><h1><b>Necromancy</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Death Majicks</b><br />
<br />
These majicks are what ALL Obsidian elves will learn, regardless of their school of Sorcery.<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <i>Summon Spirits</i> - summons the dead, necromancer can speak with the dead.
</li><li> <i>Zombie Touch</i> - those who are touched turn into Zombies
</li><li> <i>Lamia Touch</i> - those who are touched turn into Blood Vampyres
</li><li> <i>Aluka Touch</i> - those who are touched turn into Essence Vampyres
</li><li> <i>Circle of Death</i> - casts a ring around enemies and drains their lifeforce
</li><li> <i>Undeath to Death</i> - kills the undead
</li></ul>
<br />
<b>Necromatic Enchantments</b><br />
<br />
Only highly powerful Necromancers will ever be able to perform these spells as well as the death majicks, most learn either one or the other set of spells.<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <i>Apparition</i> - Summons a lost spirit from Oblivion and controls it. This can be used to scare or for more macabre reasons, some apparitions have driven people mad, and caused suicides.
</li><li> <i>Hex/Doom</i> - Sentence of Death. It is the curse of death that will slay the person it was cast upon if the curse is not lifted.
</li><li> <i>Simulacrum</i> - this spell creates a replication of oneself or another creature/being.
</li><li> <i>Assimilate</i> - the essence, body and will of another is assimilated into the necromancer. This spell is often used to gather information or to pretend to be the person who is assimilated.
</li><li> <i>Blight</i> - This spell will wither plants and vegetation, a death spell on the natural world, often used as blackmail to farmers, or a curse upon a nation and its stores. The larger the target, the harder this spell is to perform. The blight an entire crop takes much skill and power in the Ether, few can perform this on a grand scale.
</li><li> <i>Clone</i> - When this spell is cast a Duplicate awakens when original person dies. This could be the necromancer or another. The Duplicate is more of a copy then a replication and will fade after a time. The Duplicate does not have the same magical abilities the original had either. Mostly just used to deliver a message if the original dies.
</li><li> <i>Astral Projection</i> - Projects the necromancer to another place, and sometimes another plane. Very few necromancers in history have achieved this ponce, let alone mastered the spell.
</li><li> <i>Soul Bind</i> - Traps a newly dead soul to prevent resurrection
</li><li> <i>Wail of the Banshee</i> - The necromancer can summon a banshee (which is the spirit that mourns death) causing those who hear to go mad, as the living go insane upon hearing the wail of a banshee./font
</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Alchemy_b_'></a><h1><b>Alchemy</b></h1>
<br />
The creation or alteration of raw materials<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <i>Synthesize</i> - Compounds and constructs the raw materials in preparation for other spells such as forge, imbue and amalgamate.
</li><li> <i>Imbue</i> - fuses objects which magical properties
</li><li> <i>Forge</i> - forges magical weapons
</li><li> <i>Amalgamate</i> - blending different materials, like metals, jewels and magic into a fusion of Amal-misceo Items.
</li><li> <i>Evanescence</i> - Only this spell can destroy an alchemists work. Only the best Alchemists can perform it without the potion. Even with the potion, only an Alchemist will be taught these spells.
</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Evocation_b_'></a><h1><b>Evocation</b></h1>
<br />
Eradication or forceful removal of an object, be it inanimate or organic.<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <i>Banish</i> - Banishes the target to another plane of existence or place in this realm.
</li><li> <i>Repel</i> - Sends out a wave of energy that pushes away targets in the vicinity. The closer a target is, the more damage is caused. Those within a few feet of the sorcerer can sometimes be killed by the blast, depending on the strength of the sorcerer.
</li><li> <i>Reflect</i> - Casts a shield that acts as a mirror, spells cast upon the sorcerer are reflected back to the enemy spell caster ten fold.
</li><li> <i>Draw</i> - Takes energy, abilities and essence from the target. If the sorcerer maintains the connection, he/she can draw out every drop of life and magic, sapping the enemy dry.
</li><li> <i>Summon Demon</i> - Calls upon a demon from one of the Other Realms. The creature will do the bidding for the sorcerer. The strength and skill of the sorcerer effects which demons can be called upon and for how long. The stronger the sorcerer, the longer and more ferocious and evil the demon they can call upon.
</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Mirage_b_'></a><h1><b>Mirage</b></h1>
<br />
Deception and bending reality<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <i>Glamour</i> – projecting a false image upon a person, including oneself. Disguising one's features and even one's voice.
</li><li> <i>Ignis Fatuus</i> - Hallucination: projecting a mass hallucination, or a simple one for a few in number. Effects the individual directly, each person seeing either the same thing or whatever the sorcerer puts in their individual minds.
</li><li> <i>Phantasm</i> – creating an apparition, usually to deceive a single person. Always appears as a ghost. Different from the necromancers apparition spell as this is not an actual spirit, just the mirage of one. The sorcerer can do with it as he/she pleases, using it for their own ends.
</li><li> <i>Daydream</i> - The sorcerer can place daydreams into the head of their target. Often used as a distraction.
</li><li> <i>Nightmare</i> - While the target sleeps the sorcerer casts a spell that controls their dreams and turns them into nightmares...a poor version of other sorcery spells where the Nightmare can actually be conjured and given life.
</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Bewitchment_b_'></a><h1><b>Bewitchment</b></h1>
<br />
Spells that control people or objects. Strong minds are needed for this kind of magic, and often mind sorcerers are the one's who excel in this school of sorcery. Forcing your will upon the world is key to succeeding with these spells. This is the most innovative schools of sorcery as Bewitchers are always finding new ways to control, torture and have people to their bidding.<br />

</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Decimation_b_'></a><h1><b>Decimation</b></h1>
<br />
Destroying/obliterating the target. Decimator's are the most insane and unpredictable of sorcerers. Wild, angry and often out of control, their spells are the most destructive and the one's to fear in a battle. Most who enter a fight with a Decimator, do not often defeat them.<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <i>Dispell</i> – decimates the connection to magic that ANY magic user has, destroys all shields and wards.
</li><li> <i>Venom Strike</i> - Strikes the targets with poison.
</li><li> <i>Purple Chain Lightning</i> - Decimates a target with purple lightening summoned from the air around them and sometimes if the soul is black enough, they can conjure it from nothing, and feed it through their hands.
</li><li> <i>Maelstrom</i> – a storm of confusion and chaos.
</li><li> <i>Nemesis</i> – conjures/summons the worst fear of the target.
</li><li> <i>Nigredo</i> – This is a torture spell, used to cause maximum despair. This is done in different degrees, starting from the putrefaction and decomposition of flesh and ending with death.
