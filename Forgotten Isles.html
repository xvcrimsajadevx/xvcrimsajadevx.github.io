<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Forgotten Isles<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> North of the Nether Realm, an archipelago on the southern edge of the Dark Continent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns, cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
These individual Islands have towns, harbours and wilderness like any other islands... except they are polluted with dark creatures and the home of the Obsidian Elves.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Capital_Onyx_City_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital - Onyx City:</b></h2>
<br />
The primary City of the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a>, it is located on the southern coast Shadia - the southernmost and largest land mass in the Forgotten Isles. The Onyx City is a fortress and the central spire of the city is the Onyx Tower and is the abode of the Obsidian Elves leader. This is the capital of the Obsidian Elves Realm.<br />
<br />
There is only one other island inhabited by the Obsidian's, the Onyx Isle. The city of Alagardia is in the very centre, and is the home of many of the Generals and some higher noble houses. Roads spider out and to the coast where port towns are packed with ships with jet black sails. This isle is where the Shadow Kindreds are bred and raised, and the other islands in the Forgotten Isles are inhabited by the feral dragons. Only those Obsidians who are most skilled in dragon rearing and taming can survive the other islands.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
There are no other major cities as such (apart from Alagardia and the Onyx City), mainly shanty towns and small villages, mining towns and Dragon Birthing Sites in the mountains. The Forgotten Isles are the main habitation of the Obsidian Elves and the native animals are ferocious beasts that were twisted by the darkness' curse upon this blighted land. Obsidian's rarely build anything, and are quite nomadic. They fight too much amongst themselves to establish any kind of sophisticated society. The most efficiently run communities are the port towns where the nobles trade their slaves and food and textiles come into port and are distributed throughout the Isles. The army barracks are valley's filled with tents that are normally close by the the dragon aeries and the mountains. The clan leaders each raise a breed of dragon, and form their own units in the great Army of Darkness. These units move but generally stay in their Clan Territories.<br />
<br />
There is very little agriculture due to the nature of the polluted soil and acid rains.<br />
<br />

<br />
The leader of the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> is simply known as <a title="Abraxis" href='Abraxis.html' class='wiki'>Abraxis</a>. None know his true origins. He looks like an Obsidian Elf but none of the Elders know him or remember him awakening with them in the Alumi Grove. Many suspect he is indeed a Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. As unusual as it is for a Thyrza to not declare themselves, it is not unknown for it to happen. Regardless of this his influence means none question him or his origins.<br />
<br />
The hierarchy of the Obsidian Elves is as follows;<br />
<br />
<ul><li> Abraxis - he has no title, no rank, he is simply the elf all defer to.
</li><li> Elders - The exact number of surviving dark elf Elders is unknown. They distinguish themselves by the tattoos on their arms and necks. Both male and female.
</li><li> Generals - The great armies of the Obsidian Elves are led by one of twelve generals. Each general is the head of their clan. There are twelve major clans in Obsidian Elf Society.
</li><li> Nobles - In each clan there are a handful of dark elf nobles. They have no authority over anyone above them in the hierarchy but are the main keepers and dealers of slaves - it is how they make their wealth. Nobles even use and trade common Obsidian Elves as slaves.
</li><li> Commoners - The lowest on the ladder, and the most numerous. These are the workers, the soldiers, the smithy's, the servants and slaves of this society. They live a brutal life and generally are far less sophisticated then those above them. They live in there clans and often fight amongst each other.
</li></ul>

<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
<a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> all worship the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>. Death is their God, but they do not believe <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> is a god. They worship the true evil that the Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are the epitome of, and they serve the true Darkness. The only race to live so close to the Vortex on the Dark Continent, their culture is reminiscent of the vampyres, except they reject their elven counterparts and their society completely. They have evolved into a much darker race then they were originally, twisted by their death majicks and their sorcery.<br />
<br />
They do not have a religion as such, and very few temples are built to worship any god. Their temples are purely for sacrifices, the alters are stained with the blood of their prisoners and slaves as well as their own people. They are a savage society, and the common obsidians live in a society which is animalistic and territorial. It is survival f the fittest, and if you are weak, you die. They value majick and seek power, and produce nothing of worth beyond an terrible army. Their architecture is monstrous, are feeble mockery of what their cousins the Mountain Elves produce. There only feat of note is the Onyx tower, and that - it is rumoured - was built by <a title="Abraxis" href='Abraxis.html' class='wiki'>Abraxis</a> himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
Each Clan has its own laws, there are no universal laws established, beyond All <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> must be utterly destroyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
The Slave Trade is an important part of Obsidian Trade. Obsidian's rarely grow their own produce so must import almost everything from abroad. They mine gold, jewels and precious mithril. On the Dark Continent are thousands of mithril mines, and slaves mine them. A constant supply of labour goes into the mines, but never come out. Life expectancy in the mines is about a year.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
There is a Rebellion of Obsidian Elves called The Lost. They have an unknown number and are in all parts of Obsidian Society. They are nobles, they are Generals, and some are even Elders... They believe in reconnecting with <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> and overthrowing <a title="Abraxis" href='Abraxis.html' class='wiki'>Abraxis</a> and returning to Elvenhome to be cleansed by the Alumi Tree.<br />
