<br />
<br />
<b>RACE:</b> Mostly Human<br />
<br />
<b>COUNTRY/REGION:</b> Mainly Avalon, they come from different countries as Adonii has many temples all over Avalon.<br />
<br />
<b>LIFESPAN:</b> As they are magic users, albeit untrained, their lifespan is that of magic users. They age, but very slowly. To look like a forty year old they would have to be around 700.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b><br />
<br />
Most of its members tend to be female, and like their god <a title="Adonii" href='Adonii.html' class='wiki'>Adonii</a> they dress in very revealing apparel. Every member has a tattoo of a lightning bolt on their back. None of them wear metal, as it interferes with their magic, but they do like to wear diamonds. Using their beauty and 'charms' they often get what they want and convert vagrants and gullible people to serve <a title="Adonii" href='Adonii.html' class='wiki'>Adonii</a>. Only her Children are allowed in her temple where it is believed they serve her completely naked. Very tanned people (those who do not have olive skin use magic to create it), they use their magic to set themselves apart from the rest of the world and other <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> worshippers. The white streaks in their hair is their other trademark.<br />
<br />
<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b><br />
<br />
Explosive and vengeful, the Children of <a title="Adonii" href='Adonii.html' class='wiki'>Adonii</a> seek to dominate society and use their magic to force people to submit to them. Very rarely do they have open battles, they tend to use charms and seductions, influencing high nobles and even monarchs. Not to be crossed, they will react with vengeance if they feel they have been slighted. Their sisters are the most important people to them, forsaking family and lovers, dedicating themselves to their goddess, with the promise of being like her and having ultimate power. The older children have been around for many generations and feel they are above humans, that they themselves are more then human.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
The origins of this 'religion' are murky. After <a title="Adonii" href='Adonii.html' class='wiki'>Adonii</a> appeared on Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> she was content with playing with the humans rather then ruling them. It was not until <a title="Iri" href='Iri.html' class='wiki'>Iri</a> slighted her and was seduced by a human woman that she began to seek to dominate. Looking to raise an army against her former lover, she recruited these weak human magic users to fight for her. Over time she realised that much more subtle methods were successful. Subversions and assassinations dealt a heavier blow then open battle. Her followers adopted her attitude to men and used and abused them for their own ends.<br />
