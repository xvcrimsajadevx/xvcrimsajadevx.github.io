<a name='_b_Wizard_Central_b_'></a><h1><b>Wizard Central</b></h1>
<br />
The wizarding isles consist of one large island surrounded by seven smaller ones. The central island is called 'Meru' and is the heart of the Wizarding World. It has everything on that island, including villages for each of the schools of wizardry. Most of the trade to the isles go through Meru, being the biggest it can support more people and the coming and goings of trade ships and merchant trains. It is a true community of diversity, all races welcomed and many pilgrims visiting it to ask the wizards for their help and wisdom. Taverns and markets and shops are busy at all times, Meru is truly the capital of wizards in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
The wizarding council has its headquarters on this island. The city of Merua is where the Hall of the Ancients is situated. This hall was built on the exact spot that the first Elders of Wizardry met and formed the schools of Wizardry and the first spells of white magic's. The Hall of the Ancients is one huge, pillared room that contains a round table with seven throne like seats around it. The cold stone is heated by huge fires on the four walls. The walls themselves are bare, but the pillars have the symbols for each of the schools of wizardry. Only council members are allowed into the Hall.<br />

<b>MAERA KILNOOK</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF DIVINATION AND HEALING</i><br />
<br />
Maera rarely leaves her castle on the island of Lunkar (LOON-ka). As the most adept in Healing an Divination many believe her to be the only wizard to have ever resurrected a soul from Oblivion that has been there for more then a day. For most Divination Wizards to restore a soul into a body that has just died and is not decomposed is difficult and done by only a few. for Maera however, it is believed she retrieved the lost soul and healed the decomposed body also...<br />

<br />
<b>MORWIN RAVENSTALK</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF ALCHEMY</i><br />
<br />
Morwin is the Wizarding ambassador to the Dwarves of Nsgarith and has had close affiliations with them for over three hundred years. Her methods are taught on her island, Paelos (PAY-los), her school is one of the toughest to graduate from and few complete the training. Many pyromancers develop in this school and a few hushed cases of Pyro-Magi<a href="" title="Create page: Pyro-Magi" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> have been covered up by the Alchemists. Morwin is a tough women, as hardy as the dwarves and has been responsible for some of the Light's most famous weapons. Rumour has it she had a hand in making Excalibur.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<b>ARCEMEDES</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF INVOKATION</i><br />
<br />
The most renowned wizard in the entire Nether Realm. Historian, teacher, pioneer. Arcemedes is the only known wizard to have mastered the Tempora Grimoire, which contains the most powerful Invokation Time spells ever complied. It is believed that he can see the future, the past and events in the present, which explains the expanse of his Library. The most knowledgeable being in the Nether Realm (except for Eleph of course, which some believe he has contact with) you would be hard pressed to find a fact or subject Arcemedes is not an expert on. Always residing in his tower on the island of Caraes (KA-rees), he has many apprentices and assistants that gather information and pictures and artefacts for him all over the Nether Realm. Well connected and well versed in all languages and all cultures and peoples.<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<br />
<b>GARWIG ESTBRUN</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF ILLUSION</i><br />
<br />
The weakest of wizarding schools the Head of Illusion tends to be quite the recluse and somewhat defensive about his school of Wizardry. Attracting the laziest of students and the pratical jokers, most are hired my Royalty and Nobles to do displays. Not the most respected school, something that irks Garwig, he tends to live alone in his cottage on the school grounds, on the Island of Mursoocha (MORE-sue-ka)<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<b>WINATHEL WARDHILD</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF ENCHANTMENT AND CHARM</i><br />
<br />
Winathel is an old crone, but do not let that fool you. She is the most powerful Enchanter of all Wizards and uses her crone disguise for a very good reason. Her true face is not known as she came to the Wizarding Isles as an old woman. She is the daughter of one of the Grand Masters in Lightsbane, her mother stole her raised her in Nyoryn not wanting her daughter to serve the House of Sorcery. Winathel nursed her mother in her illness and watched her die, and soon after made the trip to the Wizarding Isles fulfilling her mothers dying wish for her to train as a wizard. With a natural talent for Charm, she specialised and soon became the Head of this school. Her home is on the Island of Illnoon (EEL-noon), but her heart is always in Nyoryn.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<b>MERLIN WINDWALKER</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF CONJURATION</i><br />
<br />
The Isle of Ma√©ta (MAY-ta) is the home of Merlin and his students. A very popular school, as most of the wizards are trained in combat majicks, Merlin is the most proactive and vocal wizards on the Council. He believes wizards should be more involved in human affairs and help to keep the peace on Avalon. Many Wizards of Conjuration are sent to Avalon to help out where they can and even to become advisor's to those in power.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<b>BALDRATH LEYWIN</b><br />
<br />
<i>HEAD OF ABJURATION AND ALTERATION</i><br />
<br />
Baldrath's school on the Island of Chrato (KRAY-tow) is one of the strangest of all the wizarding isles. Experiments are headed by the Head of the school, Baldrath, her transfiguration and transformation spells taught only to the members of her school. Shrouded in secrecy and her secrets guarded fiercely, she is the oddest and dottiest of the Heads of Wizardry and often disregarded as a nobody. This is a very foolish thing to do, as she did not become the head of abjuration for no reason...<br />

<a name='_b_History_of_the_Circle_b_'></a><h1><b>History of the Circle</b></h1>
<br />
When the first humans to have the talent for magic realised the implications of such power, they sought each other out. Some wanted to use their powers to help the Light, some to aid the Darkness. A battle ensued from which only a few survivors emerged. Of these the fourteen leaders of sorcery and wizardry made their opposing camps.<br />
<br />
The site that marks this battle is believed to be the true Nexus in Avalon. The wizards were the first to realise this, and claimed it for themselves, protecting it with their impenetrable white magic's, through which the sorcerer's are yet to break through.<br />
<br />
The wizards rallied together and gathered their numbers to the north of the Nether Realm. They made the Wizarding Isles with their own magic's. Meru became their headquarters and they established the schools of wizardry and scattered them throughout the archipelago. Drawing those who wanted to serve the Light with their talent, and teaching all forms of magic's (except the elemental magic's) their numbers swelled. In recent years the amount of wizards has drastically decreased, and the numbers coming to the Isles to learn is dwindling...<br />
<br />
The Circle meets to decide what they need to do as wizards to help the Nether Realm fight the Darkness. Aid has been sent to the Elves and dwarves in the past, alliances with the Alatus, the dragons the Azail. They are the diplomats, the wise ones, and sometimes people listen, most of the time they do not. They rule the wizards and their decisions are always final.<br />
