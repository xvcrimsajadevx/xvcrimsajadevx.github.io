<b>CREATED BY IRONSIDE</b><br />
<br />
Name: Mirikha<br />
<br />
Type: Lizard<br />
<br />
Region: The Great Desert<br />
<br />
Description: About four feet tall and seventeen feet long from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail, which possesses a set of four spikes, each about a foot long. Mirikha have four legs, each of which ends in a wide “foot”, offering better stability on the uneven sand. Males have longer snouts and spikes, but are generally a foot shorter in height, and five feet shorter in length. However, their teeth and tail barbs are several inches longer. Mirikha possess large fat stores in their bellies which they draw from during the cold nights of the desert.<br />
<br />
Mirikha are robust, muscular creatures that possess a thin layer of fat, giving their rough scales a soft feel underneath. Their scales are a dusty beige, bordering brown on their top and white on their underside.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Unthreatening to humanoids, Mirikha are largely peaceful animals that will only attack when threatened, choosing to stick to herds of six or seven. Mirikha sleep for only one or two hours a night. Mirikha herds constantly move in search of food.<br />
<br />
Mirikha are simple to domesticate, and are often used as mounts for traversing the desert, carrying both goods and travellers. They are popular as mounts due to their ease of maintenance and hardiness, their strong muscles useful for carrying heavy loads.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Mirikha are accustomed to the baking heat and freezing cold of the sandy desert.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Being lizards, Mirikha lay eggs which are subsequently buried under the sands, usually near insect nests. When the babies hatch, they burrow into such nests and eat until strong enough to make their way up onto the surface, where they join the first herd they find. Mirikha lay about five eggs at a time.<br />
<br />
Diet: Eats whatever it can find, including dead animals and scarce plant matter, as well as insects (unearthed termite mounds seem to be a favourite). Dead animals that are found are generally swallowed whole if smaller than the Mirikha, their stomachs capable of digesting even bone (although metal equipment on fallen travellers can cause internal injuries, as they are unable to digest it). Mirikha are known for their incredibly slow metabolism as well as efficient fat stores, enabling them to function for days without a decent meal, a trait that is particularly useful in the desert (however due to their size, “a decent meal” is actually quite a lot).<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Prey, uses its muscular jaws and barbed tail to defend itself from aggressors. However their biggest defence is the fact they travel in herds.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Strong enough to break a man’s back with their tails alone, or crush metal in their powerful jaws, Mirikha only attack when provoked, and domesticated Mirikha are even more docile, although some desert travellers have been known to use their mounts in battle.<br />
