<b>Name:</b> Eraosia<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> West of Avalon<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns, cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Capital_Eri_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital- Eri</b></h2>
<br />
The capital of Eraosia reflects the country and those who rule it. For miles and miles the land is scourged and covered with the shanty houses of the slums. The walls of the main city do not allow passage for these poor wretches, but the slums are as much a part of Eri as the noble houses and palace of Drakki<a href="" title="Create page: Drakki"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Inside the walls the taverns and the merchant residents are falling into disrepair and weathered. The streets have less rats and garbage then the slums, but they are still fairly rotten. The smell of the slums lingers here, but for most resident's of Eri, they are used to it. The degradation of the pleasure district runs throughout all parts of the city. The river docks or dilapidated and falling apart, the river left to the smugglers and ignored by the so-called authorities.<br />
The Palace is built around the original Temple grounds dedicated to the god of Eraosia, <a title="Uphaz" href='Uphaz.html' class='wiki'>Uphaz</a>. It is bathed in gold and shines atop the hill that overlooks the dank city. The thoroughfare that leads to the palace gates has the houses of the nobles dotted along it. The inner city is reserved for the rich only, and is in slightly better shape then the rest of the city.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Pan_b_'></a><h2><b>Pan</b></h2>
<br />
River Klim and Qui start a mile to the north east of Pan. The slums of this city line the rivers and the pollution of the water from the city often leaves the poor in a state of disease and death. Pan is on the flat lands and in the flood plains. A city of industry and where the factories for refining the metals and jewels from the mines in the north are situated. The sky is blighted by smoke and pollution and the earth scarred. Little edible vegetation is able to grow for up to fifty miles around Pan.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Uritinu_b_'></a><h2><b>Uritinu</b></h2>
<br />
One of Eraosia's fort cities and situated on the <a title="Fenlar" href='Fenlar.html' class='wiki'>Fenlar</a> border. This city supplies itself from Fenlar, using it trees and water to sustain it. For centuries Fenlar has not been able to stop Eraosia invaded that part of the land and for a few miles into Fenlar on the western border, Eraosia takes it fill and persecutes the Fenlari people. Uritinu is the training ground for most of the Eraosian Army and is relatively protected by the rivers and the valleys. A typical Eraosian Fort, simple, ugly and set in the midst of the beauty of Fenlar and the pollution of Eraosia. It is always populated and sustains the surrounding villages.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Yenwha_b_'></a><h2><b>Yenwha</b></h2>
<br />
Eraosia's busiest port city, and the hub of trade. The slave trade and pirates are allowed to roam freely here, making the place unruly. Paupers from the slums of Eraosia's cities are used as currency in Yenwha, often traded for food, supplies, and jewels. Even magical folk are sold to the shifty pirates who then do trade to the north in Sedana. The city is huge and the bay of Yena is always filled with ships. The Azail do not do business here but some of their ships are manned by pirates and Eraosian's. The city itself stops when the land becomes uneven and hard to build upon. Raiders from the hills often come down and take cargo and people from the slums that border the city. The city has buildings of poor construction which are rebuilt every few years after the hurricanes have hit and the sea storms has destroyed the docks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Kalishin_b_'></a><h2><b>Kalishin</b></h2>
<br />
Eraosia's most prominent Fort City and situated on the northern frontier. Battered and rebuilt on several occasions, Kalishin is another city that could use the mountain elves stone masonry. Destroyed by <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a> on several occasions, this city is merely the hub of the army, and mainly consists of tents and the odd stone building. It has a wall surrounding it, but inside it is mainly barracks and stables. Eraosian's have given up rebuilding and instead use the water supplies, the wells and pumps and the roads that surround Kalishin, and the shell of the city as a base of operations. The few stone buildings are used by the Decimators, and rarely entered by normal soldiers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Terlan_b_'></a><h2><b>Terlan</b></h2>
<br />
A picturesque town in the deep south of Eraosia. Set in a deep valley with one of Eraosia's few clean rivers flowing through it, Terlan is a farming community, and the closest to pure and clean Eraosia as one is likely to find. It is quiet and unspoiled and free of higher nobles reign or the army. Self sustaining, and ruled over by an elected mayor, the town has a few estates and taverns, inns and a town hall. The clock tower a feature of this town.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Filiriku_b_'></a><h2><b>Filiriku</b></h2>
<br />
A fort town on the eastern border with <a title="Fenlar" href='Fenlar.html' class='wiki'>Fenlar</a>. A community that supports the army, whose farms supply the army and whose people man the army. Filiriku citizens have a deep hatred and jealousy of Fenlar. The barracks surround the town, and the army fill its taverns and use its whores and dominate its people. These people are abused and used and long for the life and freedom of the people of Fenlar, yet they subsidise the life of the soldiers and refuse to stand up for them. They are loyal to Eraosia and believe in the greater good, and that the Army have every right to step on them, as they defend against the heathens of <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> and <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a> in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Rudnol_b_'></a><h2><b>Rudnol</b></h2>
<br />
A mining community set in the mountains of southern Eroasia. These are the mines that produce 80% of Eraosia's wealth. Wide roads go from Rudnol all the way to Eri and they are always busy with mining carts running along the tracks, filled with gold, mithril and all manner of jewels. The town is a fairly happy community, benefiting from the nobles who have their winter manors in the area. The town is well kept and looked after, as it is the heart of Eraosia's wealth and the place that all rich Eraosian's want to keep happy and stable. A heavily armed force patrols the region as it is a target for their enemies. Take away Eraosia's wealth and take her heart. Another temple of <a title="Uphaz" href='Uphaz.html' class='wiki'>Uphaz</a> is also situated in the mountains above the mines and the Magus visit here often.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Holwyn_b_'></a><h2><b>Holwyn</b></h2>
<br />
Another fort town that guards the river Qui that flows into <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a>. This is the inland hub of trade as many river boats from the north send a receive supplies from Holwyn. As the surrounding area's are some of the most fertile farmland and forests Holwyn is a fairly rich town and heavily populated. Although is has a heavy military presence it is a more relaxed town then most. Its location, being so close to the border may be a reason for its more light hearted approach to life, blood mixed with the easy going Adenian's highly likely. Built along the river banks, its streets are wide to support the cargo wagons, and its docks well maintained and built by the Adenian's long ago. It is a loud town, the taverns and street markets giving the place life, the trade of the country giving it health, and the money from the trade giving the people happiness. The buildings and residents reflect this. Better built, more maintained then those in the huge cities, and few slums.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Inimaku_b_'></a><h2><b>Inimaku</b></h2>
<br />
Surrounded by forest and on the southern border, this isolated fort is the quietest and most relaxed place with an army presence. Only fifty miles from the coast, and well supplied by the forest and flatlands, Inimaku is the Fort that is the home of General Zsaka. The families of soldiers live in and around the town, and the people are self sufficient. Farmers and warriors work alongside one another. Soldiers train here in peace and sustain themselves by working the fields to produce food for the army that runs the town. Set deep within the forest, its walls can only just be seen from the plains in the surrounding area. the watchtowers are lofty and always have eyes, but there are no Decimators here, making the place far more relaxed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Saeniz_b_'></a><h2><b>Saeniz</b></h2>
<br />
Eraosia's only port town and a very quiet one at that. Being so far from the cities it has its own laws. The main one being no slave trading and no smuggling. This has gone unnoticed for generations and the rulers of Eraosia have never noticed this towns flouting of its dodgy laws. Instead it does business with more reputable merchants and allows passage into Eraosia to almost anyone. Large ships cannot enter its bay, as the shallows of the harbour only support smaller ships. The town is a picturesque harbour town, but with an undertone of what makes Eraosia a bad place to be. The nobles allow the laws to be so flexible as here they can do as they please. The people are still downtrodden here, but they accept it because they have good jobs, they live by the sea and have well built houses and good crops.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Qualenes_b_'></a><h2><b>Qualenes</b></h2>
<br />
In the north east of Eraosia and north of the River Klim, this town is plagued by the beasts of the marshes. To the north the Marshes are inhabited by twisted creatures that are a curse upon Qualenes. A fortified town that is often left on its own and never given any aid, it is only visited by the most desperate of travellers, and a safe haven upon the road north to Yaquinta and the northern frontier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
Their are pockets of beauty in this country that harken back to the times when Eraosia was a place of forests, and farms and beautiful valleys and gorges. Now it is polluted by the cities, ravaged by wild beasts, villages are left to fend for themselves and people try to escape the plagues of the wilds by travelling to the cities, where they are forced to live in the slums. Eraosia is a land where the rich only get richer, and the poor die. They worship wealth and put all there energy into increasing it, rather then making their country a better place to be. They deal in warfare and the army is considered the middle classes. The upper classes are noble blood only, no one can achieve wealth or buy their way into the aristocracy. Any poor soul who thinks they are lucky enough to get rich and discover a gold mine soon have the noble vultures descend upon them to take the gold for themselves.<br />
<br />
Most of the land is plagued with marshes and land not suitable for farming. Because of this Eraosia has to rely on trade to supply their people with food. This food rarely reaches the poor in the slums as the rich take it all for themselves. The people would riot if is was not for the Emperor. They have a firm belief that this is the way of things, that <a title="Uphaz" href='Uphaz.html' class='wiki'>Uphaz</a> will grant them wealth in the afterlife for their faithfulness and for keeping the peace. They are often told this by preachers, who travel the slums and isolated villagers, telling them of the Will of Uphaz and the punishment their souls will suffer if they rebel against Drakki<a href="" title="Create page: Drakki"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and Uphaz.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_People_of_Eraosia_b_'></a><h1><b>The People of Eraosia:</b></h1>
<br />
Sorcerer's - <a title="House Lightsbane" href='House+Lightsbane.html' class='wiki'>House Lightsbane</a> has individual wealth and has its roots in Eraosia. They are a law unto themselves and do not even come under the jurisdiction of Drakki. Yet they do affiliate with the emperor and supply him with the <a title="Magus" href='Magus.html' class='wiki'>Magus</a>. It is a give and take relationship and puts any sorcerer high up in Eraosia's hierarchy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Nobles_b_'></a><h2><b>Nobles</b></h2>
<br />
The smallest percentage of the population, and the richest. Nobles rule the people in their regions but are all overseen by Drakki<a href="" title="Create page: Drakki"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. These nobles bicker with one another and try to assassinate one another to claim more land but they all obey the Emperor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Soldiers_b_'></a><h2><b>Soldiers</b></h2>
<br />
Any member of the army is considered the middle class. This is the life most people strive for, as they get to serve their god and emperor and they have a better standard of life. It is a simple life, but a retired soldier gets his own home and pension.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Commoners_b_'></a><h2><b>Commoners</b></h2>
<br />
Tavern owners, merchants, whores, servants, holy men. Anyone with a living is the common people of Eraosia. These people have better lives on the outskirts of Eraosia, particularly in the south where they have more freedom and less interference from the Nobles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Paupers_b_'></a><h2><b>Paupers</b></h2>
<br />
Slum dwellers. People who have moved from their ruined villagers to the cities and found themselves in the slums. Often failed farmers and their families, over the generations the slum-dwellers have evolved into a class of their own. As the country has gone to wrack and ruin the percentage of the population in this class has risen drastically.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
The Emperor of Eraosia is a warmonger and warlord. He desires power. wealth and totality. He has disposed of, anyone who displeases him and gets in his way. He is a high priest of <a title="Uphaz" href='Uphaz.html' class='wiki'>Uphaz</a> and drapes himself in gold and jewels. He wears a golden mask that is of no beast or creature, it fits his face perfectly and is made of gold. No one has ever seen Drakki Dra's face.<br />
<br />
He is a dictator and changes the members of his Court often, to maintain his stronghold on the country and to avoid assassination. He has a daughter, Lilith (her name meaning bearer of disease, illness, and death), a beautiful priestess of Uphaz.<br />
<br />
Nobles are assigned their estates and rule the regions in the name of Drakki<a href="" title="Create page: Drakki"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are under his authority and he often plants spies to tell him of any treachery within the noble ranks and often disposes of the head of houses.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Magus" href='Magus.html' class='wiki'>Magus</a> are his closest advisers and loyal to him.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
Eraosia's culture is restricted. Growth is controlled and art and industry strangled by the will of Drakki. The army is the only part of their culture allowed to thrive and the pursuit of wealth poisons the minds of every Eraosian. There are off course area's where the Emperor's influence does not reach, and these area's tend to be secretive but more affluent.<br />
<br />
The culture of the cities is that of power and totalitarianism. the people are subdued and crushed and the wealthy rule all. The commoners are downtrodden and the paupers left to die in their own filth.<br />
<br />
The religion is simple. The pursuit of Gold and Wealth is the most important thing. Materialism and power is what most Eraosian's aspire to and will seek it at all costs. They have an organised religion, and worship the Djinn Uphaz. It is often debated in more sophisticated circles of Avalon the origins of this religion,. Did Uphaz make Eraosia or did he choose Eraosia because of its selfish values and beliefs?<br />
<br />
Temples of Uphaz are grand and dripping in gold and wealth. Often there will be a temple not two miles from some of the worst area's of the land, the temple's needs sucking the region dry...<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
The laws benefit the rich and powerful. Nobles oppress the citizens and never judge fairly. Poverty is ignored.<br />
<br />
Smuggling is legal, but there are certain items that are outlawed. Anything Azaili, or made by Wizard Alchemists or dwarves are things sold on the black market.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
Trade in weapons and slaves is high. <a title="Dwarves" href='Dwarves.html' class='wiki'>Dwarves</a> were originally hired to mine the mountains but when the mines had been established they were thrown out of the country unpaid and the mines were filled with Eraosian labourers, mainly slaves.<br />
<br />
The Eraosian Mark is the highest value gold piece in Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. It is the heaviest and the purest of gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
The Magus are the personal advisor's and guards of the emperor and are all graduates of <a title="House Lightsbane" href='House+Lightsbane.html' class='wiki'>House Lightsbane</a>. They are Mind Sorcerers and adept in mind reading.<br />
