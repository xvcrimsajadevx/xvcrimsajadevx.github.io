<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
 To those who have seen Tol Kyn in battle, they are determined, methodical, and without fear. Tol Kyn soldiers were highly prized mercenaries in their early history. They are rarely caught off guard, and have little respect for most other tribes and peoples. Their leaders have varied from ruthless to honorable and wise, and depending on the era, they can be saviors or villains.<br />
<br />
<b>History:</b><br />
<br />
 While little is known about them, The Tol Kyn are thought to be descended from the first Human inhabitants of Teran A'ao. They did not at first have a written languauge and so their precise origin remains a mystery. One legend of the Tol Kyn speaks of their first chieftain marrying a Magi princess, and carving a small kingdom from the desert. It is believed that the Tol Kyn (Sons of the First) were once a proud respected people numbering in the tens of thousands, but after an unknown calamity and a deadly scourge of unknown origin, their numbers diminished until the present day. Their sister tribe the Tal' Kyre (Daughters of the Second) were almost destroyed by famine and plague, and their knowledge of hand to hand combat was combined with the warrior heritage of the Tol Kyn. Females and males are encouraged to become warriors, and at the age 18 are sent to make their way to the pilgrimage spot of the ancestors...a stone shrine near the coast.<br />
<br />
The spear is the singular and most recognizable weapon of the Tol Kyn. Typically 6 feet in length with leather grips and an iron or copper tip. The spear is the outward visible sign of a warrior, as are the protective coverings on the hands known as Cestus bands. They are taught that the spear is their life, and their death. Upon the end of a warriors life, the spear is burned and the tip forged into a new spear, and given to the eldest son or daughter.<br />
<br />
Tol Kyn females were often considered very amorous, and driven by their desires. It was not uncommon for one Tol Kyn woman to have two or three husbands, provided that she respect all equally. Several of the more ruthless Tol Kyn leaders have been women, one in particular Shir' Tal Kyn. Shir ruthlessly slaughtered trespassers on Tol Kyn land and strived to wipe out all families along with male chiefs not loyal to her. Shir was defeated by Tyna Tol Kyn, but not before she vanished in a sandstorm with her entire army never to be seen again. Legend speaks of a time when Shir' would return, and this story is told to young Tol Kyn as a nursery rhyme.<br />
<br />
<br />
::Fear my Kyn, Fear her name,<br />
for no one knows from whence she came<br />
<br />
At night when tombs of fear surprise<br />
till judgment day her corpse arise<br />
Shir will come calling near<br />
and feel your hearts with mortal fear<br />
<br />
She comes with lance and spear and bow<br />
and all the land around shall know<br />
your death is nigh' and heart shall fail<br />
and not one man shall tell the tale.::<br />
