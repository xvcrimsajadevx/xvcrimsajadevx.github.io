The Trade Route goes through the desert and all the way to the southern coast, where docks exist that carry merchandise into the Lacanta Isles. Along this route are way stations that few still inhabit. Wizards keep the way stations stocked with food and pumps in the stone huts draw water for travellers.<br />
