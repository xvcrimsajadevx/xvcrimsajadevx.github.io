<br />

<br />
<b>APPEARANCE: </b><br />
<br />
The dark haired, dark eyed and dark tanned skin of the Yula is distinctive, and no matter what your blood, the Yula traits will dominate the children. As a nomadic people, the Yula do not tend to buy their clothes, but make them. Animal skins, and sometimes cottons and wools they have harvested while working on farms, they weave their clothes, making them very distinctive. The style is far from generic, rather it is more colourful then your average tribe. They are quite a peaceful people so do not need rangers clothes. When they hunt the men will wear camouflage, but only then. The women have dark, tanned skin and wear tassled shawls and beads in their hair. They go barefooted where they can, their people often keeping to the flatlands. With bells on their ankle chains and ribbons in their hair, they are a happy people and will wander the Nether Realm, as the wild is their home now.<br />
<br />
<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b><br />
<br />
Lively, jovial and friendly. The Yula are a mystical people, living their lives by the stars. They have the blood of all men running through their veins, and as they travel many other people from all countries continue to join their ranks and further mix their blood over the generations.<br />
<br />
They are far too trusting of others, and will accept and welcome anyone into their ranks. This does not make them stupid, there are those within the tribe who dedicate themselves to keeping the Yula safe. Often prejudiced against they are shooed on from place to place. Why people do not welcome their music and their laughter is not questioned, they simply accept it and move on. The world is their home and they do not wish to dwell in one place for too long. A flighty people, ever changing and ever moving, their personalities match their lifestyle. They are mystic, wayfaring, and kind people.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
They are probably the earliest organised human society in Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. It is believed they are pure blooded descendants of the first humans made by the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>. They have deep roots in all societies yet they have no affiliations or attachments. They are completely free.<br />
<br />
Since the beginning of humans have the Yula travelled, and they see it as the true way of life for all humans. Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is not the only place they wander, they go all over the Nether Realm, and always have done.<br />
<br />
There are no records concerning their origins or their history so we can only go by their stories that have been passed down from elder to child. These stories speak only of the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>, and their search for eternal peace.<br />
<br />
<b>MAGIC:</b><br />
<br />
Nothing that can be called magic per se. They have some form of Foretelling, make potions and ointments that are original to the Yula, and perform hexes and curses that may or may not be magical. the common belief is all are taught these things, but the degree of success with them depends on whether or not they are born as magic users. They do not send people who have the 'Talent' to the <a title="Wizarding Isles" href='Wizarding+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Wizarding Isles</a> or the <a title="Sorcerers" href='Sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>Sorcerers</a>, instead they keep them and those people become Fortune Tellers, Medicine men and women and the 'Wise Ones'.<br />
