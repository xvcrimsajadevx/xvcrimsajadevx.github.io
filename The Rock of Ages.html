It is surrounded by beautiful forests and cascading waterfalls, the temples upon it, around it and inside it. From the air a face like a sleeping giant appears to be etched upon the Rock. It has thousands of years of moss and vines and plants upon it which break and fall whenever Titan animates it. Titanâ€™s Temple is a circle of stone atop a ridge that is poised before the cave through which the voice of Titan resonates. Nature flourished here more then anywhere else, even on Lenal. It is hallowed ground and it is heresy to defile it. Only priests and priestesses are allowed to walk the Rock Groves and the mountain elves do not dwell on or near the Rock out of respect.<br />
