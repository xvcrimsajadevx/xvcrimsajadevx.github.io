<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> The Isla de la Manna<a href="" title="Create page: Isla+de+la+Manna"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a><br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> The duration in the Nether Realm is around 300 years.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
A type of Shifter<a href="" title="Create page: Shifter"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> that can morph into but one form, Draconis<a href="" title="Create page: Draconis"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
This is the Shadow Race of <a title="Zaci" href='Zaci.html' class='wiki'>Zaci</a>. Like their father they appear as a dragon-like creature, smaller <a title="dragons" href='dragons.html' class='wiki'>dragons</a> that are more serpantine then <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>s creations, the draconis having thinner and more flexible, great bat like wings and eyes that see into the Abyss. Similar in origins to the beasts of the Vigilian Flyers the draconis have a shadow like aura. When time is in the in-betweens, at midnight and midday they are very powerful creatures. It is then that all draconis in their humanoid forms feel the need to turn into draconis.<br />
<br />
In their human form they maintain aspects of their draconis. Their skin is not human skin but silky smooth scales that many mistake for tattoos. Their eyes are most definitely not human, black pools of darkness and shadow swirling, they are creatures of the Abyss and as such are able to see those who can summon, identify Vigilia and have an affinity with the Vigilian Flyers...<br />
<br />
All humanic draconis have tails, this is one feature they all retain when in humanoid form. Shifting forms is second nature to them, but when they fight in melee form they become draconis, and when they use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> they are humanoid. Those who live in human form often wear tribal apparel, carrying spears and wearing the bones of their kills. Goblin, dwarf, even dragon, it matters not to the draconis. Those who are more 'sophisticated' tend to wear druid-like robes, covering their scales and tails. They are often accused for being ashamed of their appearance and most are shunned from draconis society on Dela Manna. These are the draconis seen elsewhere in the world and the ones who tend to be more proficient magic users. Some even train in other magic, taught by wizards it is rumoured.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
An intelligent but feral race draconis are loyal to their own. The only <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a> they respect are the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a>, and they see the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> as their cousins, both being races made by the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>. Most draconis prefer their dragon-like form as they feel it is their natural state. Those who prefer to be humanoid tend to be the greatest spell casters.<br />
<br />
While the Vigilia reflect their makers in being very calm and controlled the draconis are very explosive. Zaci is a fighter and his creatures were made for the same purpose. Draconis society is not very civilised but it is organised, tribal, and centered on developing their battle traits and on returning to the shadow realm to serve their God properly. They feel trapped in their humanoid bodies.<br />
<br />
There is a faction of draconis who refuse to live in their humanoid forms and believe they must earn the right to return to their god by doing what he intended for them. These draconis are known as Shak-ri Draconi, and they seek summoners and protect them. They do this in the hope that Zaci will reward them and shorten their lifespan here on the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
The <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> Zaci used the same magic's as his brethren Ta'ko and Moriqueeta to make the draconis in the Nether Realm. He took the shadow essence of his creatures and breathed life into their humanoid fleshy temples. Upon the very ground that the first Humanis Draconis walked, on the Isla Dela Manna, the Temple of Zaci was built. <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> visit this temple to earn the right to summon the Eria, and the draconis are the Guardians of this temple and this island. Atribal society that revolves around their worship of their god they are quite isolated from the rest of the world. Those who venture abroad are often mistaken for heavily tattooed humans, until one looks closer and sees their draconis features.<br />
<br />
This race were created after the Vigilia and are more feral then their humanoid brethren. Their original purpose reflected that of their god, to help the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a>, but over time they abandoned this, wanting to be independent of the humans. Zaci punished them for this by extending their lives on the Nether Realm. Their souls are born in the <a title="Shadow Realm" href='Shadow+Realm.html' class='wiki'>Shadow Realm</a> and at birth enter the mortal vessel of the humanis. At death their soul returns to Zaci, where they serve him in the Shadow Realm. It is these former humanis that Zaci calls upon when he is summoned by the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> of the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
Every Draconis answers to Zaci and are therefore a neutral power on the Nether Realm. The Quasi fear them, but they must conquer this fear to be worthy to summon the battle <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> and earn the right to be protected by him. The draconis sift the weak from the strong and so some Quasi never leave the temple on Dela Manna.<br />
<br />

<br />
As a race of the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> they are naturally <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> Users. Neither human<a href="" title="Create page: human"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> nor draconis gives them very unique abilities. Their Shifting is limited to two forms, but while in draconis form they have the ability to enter the Shadow Realm at will and draw unique abilities from there.<br />
<br />
While in humanoid form spell casting is limited to the few spells Zaci taught in ancient times, they are etched in their ancient language upon the walls of the temple and only draconis can read them. <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> have tried and failed to gain entry into the temple, even the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> have attempted to read them even though they cannot cast the spells, but none have succeeded. Draconis magic is therefore limited but very unique.<br />
