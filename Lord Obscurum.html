<b>Backstory:</b><br />
<br />
 Not much is known of Lord Obscurum; his involvement in the slaying of the dragons and winged elves at the beginning of the last century is the most recent sighting of him. It was at the slaying that he demonstrated enormous power, slaying a dragon single-handedly and apparently ordering many un-hatched eggs to be taken away, whilst the orders be destroyed.<br />
<br />
He was also sighted at the attack on Aether, seen to be leading many of the Obsidian elves into battle. Much of these accounts consist of the same thing however; mainly his display of great power and the obvious influence he has over the Obsidian elves and sometimes, any Dark Minion. Known to be a Thyrza, much of his past has been kept hidden in shadow and whenever anyone has tried to discover the truth....well, they never live for long.<br />
<br />
His estimated age comes from the fact that he was seen at the attack on Aether; many elves are agreed that he must be at least 500 years old due to the power he displayed at the attack, but it is impossible to know for sure how old he is.<br />
