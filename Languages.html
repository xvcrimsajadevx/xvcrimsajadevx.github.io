In this world we do not have a bunch of nonsense phrases or variation in spoken language; therefore all you need to know regarding language is in this article.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Common_Tongue_b_'></a><h1><b>Common Tongue</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
There is only one spoken language in TNR. Common Tongue. the key word there is spoken. We won't be typing phrases in elvish or dragon tongue, we type and read in the Common Tongue, which is English. Not having languages for races or cultures does not mean there are no written difference sin communication. There singular words for certain things for different cultures/races. For instance, the ech Lun word for 'tribe' or 'type' is 'ka' and for the elves it is 'alumi'. these words and terms will be listed in the wiki's Glossary of Terms.<br />
<br />
Each race will have variations in the way they communicate (for instance dragons use telepathy and images and feelings when speaking to each other sometimes).<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dialects_b_'></a><h1><b>Dialects</b></h1>
<br />
This is totally up to the player, if they wish to give their character a dialect then that is fine. Dwarves tend to use word like 'ye' and 'yar' etc and pirates have a distinguishing dialect that is generic and one you are free to employ. Regional and national dialects will be normal in Avalon, so take on board what that country is like and invent your own dialect for them if you like.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Runes_and_Symbolic_Language_b_'></a><h1><b>Runes and Symbolic Language</b></h1>
<br />
All races have an ancient rune or symbolic language that they use. The Common Tongue is spoken, but the written language is regional and cultural. So an Eraosian would not always be able to read a text from Teran A'ao, and an elf not able to read Dwarven runes unless they have learnt them.<br />
