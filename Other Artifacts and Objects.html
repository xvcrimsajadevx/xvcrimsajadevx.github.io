<a name='_b_The_Orb_of_Mantir_b_'></a><h1><b>The Orb of Mantir</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Legend_b_'></a><h2><b>Legend...</b></h2>
<br />
All stories begin somewhere. Some are whispered on the wind, some written upon ancient tomes by the Gods themselves, and others are a grain of truth shrouded by the fallacies that time encouraged.<br />
<br />
The legend of the Orb of Mantir is the grain of sand. It's truth lost in a desert of lies, both white and black, protected and fabricated for reasons even the 'Gods' themselves cannot fathom.<br />
<br />
The whispers of this object of great power and mystery came from the now nomadic tribes of the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a>. The Orb has always been an object of worship for them, but its origins obscured by their secret nature and now silent tongues. The whispers grew louder though, but never did a <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> lose their tongue again to either confirm or deny. Some said the Orb was a key forged by the Gods. A key that opened the gates of paradise, gates that led to an afterlife that was an escape from the torments of <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. Others said that in life though, one must not look upon the Orb. It was believed that the Gods made it from Light and Shadow, and that the Orb glows and pulsates, like an eye opening upon universes, it is wreathed in Darkness and shining an effulgent Light. If a living creature dares to touch the Orb then they shall be granted their most solemn wish. Their true hearts desire.<br />

<a name='_b_Powers_of_the_Orb_b_'></a><h2><b>Powers of the Orb...</b></h2>
<br />
--Key and Seal (to Gates of Paradise)<br />
<br />
--Twists the desires of the Unworthy and grants them a twisted version of their hearts desire (similar to how a genie grants wishes in our mythology)<br />
<br />
--Raises the Dead - brings back an untainted soul from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>.<br />
<br />
--Reincarnates the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a><br />
<br />
--And finally - other powers depend on whom possesses the Orb (linked to the bearers desires, abilities and the shape of their heart - their innocence)<br />

&quot;Bad Guys&quot;<br />
<br />
   1. <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> - wants to break Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>'s Seal<br />
      ---Tiaiz and Rakis - need it to appease <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a><br />
      ---Bounty Hunter (Valiah??) - hired by <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a><br />
<br />
   2. Tiamat/Ilshara<a href="" title="Create page: Tiamat%FF164205%FFIlshara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> - need to stop <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> from possessing it/to gain power<br />
<br />
   3. Atean<a href="" title="Create page: Atean"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> - believes he could use it to rule <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> (he is in possession of the 'Prophecies of the Orb', these are Vigilian<a href="" title="Create page: Vigilian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Tomes he has translated)<br />
<br />
   4. <a title="Furia" href='Furia.html' class='wiki'>Furia</a> - he believes it to be a key. He does not know the extent of its powers and fears touching it, so has sent his slave to retrieve it for him<br />
<br />
   5. <a title="Kaelina" href='Kaelina.html' class='wiki'>Kaelina</a> - ???<br />
<br />
   6. <a title="Seluni" href='Seluni.html' class='wiki'>Seluni</a> - ???<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Guys&quot;<br />
<br />
   1. The <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> - seek to protect it and she who possesses it.<br />
<br />
   2. The <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> - they are unaware of the Hunt for the Orb and oblivious to the truth behind the legend (for the most part). <a title="Arcemedes" href='Arcemedes.html' class='wiki'>Arcemedes</a> and Kalkiro<a href="" title="Create page: Kalkiro"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are trying to stir the wizards into action and convince them of the summoners importance and educate their fellow wizards about the Orb. They believe it is foolish to ignore this legend as there is evidence that the Minions have nefarious plans for it and if they succeed the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> will be in peril!<br />

<a name='_b_The_Device_b_'></a><h1><b>The Device</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Legend_b_'></a><h2><b>Legend</b></h2>
<br />
The Device is a weather device created by the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>. It is a combination of majick and <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> technology and is the reason <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> can fly. It can control the weather and has been stolen and abused in the past, the result being devastating weather anomalies throughout the realm.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a> are hell bent on stealing the Device and using it to defeat the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>, as the Alatus have used it to defeat them time and again.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Powers_of_The_Device_b_'></a><h2><b>Powers of The Device</b></h2>
<br />
The Device is a blend of machinery and majick given to the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> by their <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a>. The Device is connected to keeping the city of <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> floating as well as controlling the weather in and around the city.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Who_Seeks_The_Device_and_Why_b_'></a><h2><b>Who Seeks The Device and Why...?</b></h2>
<br />
The Device is always entrusted to the Royal Family and according to the customs and laws of the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>, whoever is in possession of The Device (if not a member of the Royal Family) can petition the Council of Seats, (the High Seats of the Noble Houses) for the removal of the current Queen. Currently, in <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>, <a title="Seluci Ayperi" href='Seluci+Ayperi.html' class='wiki'>Seluci Ayperi</a> is on one such mission to find the missing Device and return to <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> to take the throne from <a title="Tallina Enlil" href='Tallina+Enlil.html' class='wiki'>Tallina Enlil</a>.<br />
<br />
Also searching for The Device are the <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a>. They <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a> are a subrace of the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>, an anomaly cast from the city and looked down upon by the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>. For centuries the <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a> have sent wave upon wave against the Floating City in an attempt to regain control of their homeland. Every army that has flown against the city has been destroyed however, by the use of the Device and the user's ability to control the weather and strike down the warring <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a> before they could fly close enough to the city to do any damage. Never giving up, the <a title="Ny'eki" href='Ny%27eki.html' class='wiki'>Ny'eki</a> continue to plot, scheme and search for The Device.<br />
