<br />
Wizards in particular have <a class="wiki"  href="http://www.thenetherrealm.com/wiki/Ether#_b_Three_Forms_of_Spellcasting_b_.html">three forms of casting</a>. For wizards who use incantation they keep records of their spells in grimoires. Some wizards may do this regardless of how they cast spells, they may be wizards who wish to record and draw a certain hand gesture, or make a note about a mind or elemental spell, or a talent they possess. An alchemist may wish to record how to make certain potions or artifacts. It totally depends on the wizard/sorcerer.<br />
<br />
Grimoires do not force you into certain ways of casting. Of course there are some spells and schools that can only be performed with the mind for instance, but even those spells can at least be recorded, and first and foremost this is what a grimoire is, a record of spells or majick. Some grimoires are handed down from mentor to apprentice, and some grimoires have majickal locks. All wizards have a basic grasp of hand majick and incantations and some simply want or need to write them down. Some make up their own (and many members have created spells, what we provide here on the wiki is a guide to give you an idea of the types of spells for schools) and some write down their original spells (wizards of conjuration being the innovates can have rather large volumes of grimoires due to having so many spells. In this case it is understandable to want to record them all).<br />
<br />
Grimoires are not a requirement and those who use incantations <i>tend</i> to have them, but this is not a rule set in stone or universal to all trained majick users. Some majick users will pride themselves on their memory and think grimoires are dangerous, and a derisive about them and wizards who use or have them.<br />
<br />
They do not necessarily have to be read for the spell to work either, that depends again on the wizard and the spell. There are no spells listed in this wiki that require this, but in my own book the main character Arcana does read from his grimoire to cast, <i>sometimes</i>. Many keep the book with them because its precious to them. The books themselves can be valuable and even majickal, it really does depend on the wizard/sorcerer. Some may use it to channel/control the Ether, stabilise and relax them, like a crutch, and some may have secret and forbidden spells.<br />

PLEASE NOTE: We really want to keep the use of grimoires as open and flexible as possible so people have the freedom to use them in whatever way suits their characters.<br />
