<a name='_b_Excalibur_b_'></a><h1><b>Excalibur</b></h1>
<br />
A legendary sword forged by the Djinn of Swords, <a title="Toah" href='Toah.html' class='wiki'>Toah</a>. It is a monstrous double handed long sword, with a hilt that bears the emblem of the great weapons master <a title="Toah" href='Toah.html' class='wiki'>Toah</a>. The runes that give the blade it power are engraved upon both sides of the steel, and glow dimly when it is wielded. When someone who is unworthy comes near its pedestal, the runes glow brighter then the sun and blind he who dares to come close.<br />
<br />
Location unknown.<br />
<br />
It’s powers are also unknown, but the legends tells that the one who wields this blade will be able to kill even the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> and <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>, and able to shatter complete armies with one swing. These may be only whispers of untruths but they may also bear some element that is complete truth. He who finds the blade will know for sure the true power of this ancient blade.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Twin_Blades_of_Time_b_'></a><h1><b>The Twin Blades of Time</b></h1>
<br />
A pair of legendary short swords, these blades were made from the shards of creation itself, and imbued with the power of time. The tale tells that their bearer will be granted eternal life – but like the elves, it will not make the bearer’s body eternal. These blades grant their wielder also the capability to move as fast as a lighting bolt. The blades are hidden by the Oracle of Wind<a href="" title="Create page: Oracle+of+Wind"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> herself, and the path to find these blades will be filled with riddles and challenges, which no mortal should be able to complete – so get a move on to prove it to be false!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Warhammer_of_Creation_b_'></a><h1><b>The Warhammer of Creation</b></h1>
<br />
A huge warhammer once told to be bore by <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> himself. A single bash against the land below your feet will tremble your reality and ruin all in your way. No one has ever acquired this powerful weapon, but it has been told that no one can take a strike, your enemy’s shield will shatter, their mind will break, and their body will be broken. This weapon bears to power of Earth, a single rock can be shaped as a deadly javelin in your hand, and if this weapon is tossed against someone, it will return to your hand after the hit. As a wise man told me once: “A warrior is no warrior without a magnificent weapon.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Godslayer_b_'></a><h1><b>Godslayer</b></h1>
<br />
<a title="Toah" href='Toah.html' class='wiki'>Toah</a> once forged the blade, Excalibur with a mysterious dark elf, but did not allow the elf to bear it, denying him the power Excalibur would’ve given him; for it would be with that power that the Gods trembled before. This elf, who helped the Djinn of Swords, didn’t get his prize as promised, and he swore revenge. In his bitter hatred he forged a blade almost as powerful as Excalibur itself. As Excalibur was believed to blind all those unworthy to see it with it’s pure glow of divine Light, the Godslayer will break all who see it with it’s malicious Darkness. The dark elf never got the chance to use the blade due his early death, and the blade was taken with him to his grave. His tomb has been told to be under the Black City of the Obsidians, inside the Altar of <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>. This blade is the darker version of Excalibur, and its brother, forged in the some forge, from the same metal. As with everything in this world there must be balance, and even the great sword Excalibur must have its foe, its equal. Legend tells us that if these swords ever met in battle, All Worlds would shake to the very core, and the blades would shatter, distorting time and creation itself will the sheer force of blades coming together.<br />
<br />
Be Warned adventurers, Who ever wields this blade, declares a war against the Gods themselves...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Scythe_of_Apollyon_b_'></a><h1><b>Scythe of Apollyon</b></h1>
<br />
Another God like relic. Apollyon's self worn scythe given to a High Priest of Apollyon long ago. This scythe allows its bearer to see into the Underworld, to the Realms of Darkness itself, and will also grant the powers of the Void, and allow the bearer to possess the most powerful necromantic spells there are to be learned. But, as the tale tells, it is hidden in the Greatest Temple of Apollyon, underground where no one can find it.<br />
<br />
He who bears the scythe has his soul bound to it, and the will of <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> can be forced upon him. The bearer's soul is partly bound to <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> but will never have to wonder in it's <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, even when death claims them. They will become wraiths, and servants of the Djinn of Death for Eternity.<br />
<br />
It is not known how many have borne the blade but many believe that the Djinn's most trusted attendants are the Scythe Wraiths.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Blades_of_Malicious_Slaughter_b_'></a><h1><b>The Blades of Malicious Slaughter</b></h1>
<br />
These two scimitars are rumoured to be the most feared blades over our realm. Once wore by Ysuran Nightfall, the uncle of the Blade Master Anmar. Some believe that Ysuran died because of his heresy, some believe him to still roam this Realm, his malice tying him exponentially to this world, never allowing him to fade. Anmar was Ysuran's one time apprentice, and when Anmar was sent out to the ocean Ysuran Nightfall forged the blades in his anger, his hatred against his brethren fuelling their making. He imbued them with this malice, this will to murder and destroy, his lust to slaughter, his vengeance for his nephew and apprentice.<br />
<br />
Legend tells that on the brink of battle these blades release Ysuran's hatred and vengeful spirit into the wielder, and awaken what the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> call the Black Fury inside the carrier. The blades bleed in battle - for the loss of their maker and the loss of his great Apprentice.<br />
<br />
Ysuran slaughtered a whole bloodline of Obsidians with these blades, and he was believed to make his final stand upon a mount south of the great Onyx Tower. Here he was believed to be slaughtered, his body desecrated. The blades vanished and their maker was thought to be gone forever.<br />
<br />
It has been told that whoever wields and masters these blades will be blessed with powerful weapons but will be cursed with the madness of Ysuran and his Vengeful Soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Wraithbringer_b_'></a><h1><b>Wraithbringer </b></h1>
<br />
This spear has no remarkable place in history. The tale does tell us that this once was the spear of an unknown horseman. As the battle ended with both sides lying dead on the battlefield, one stood alone, leaning against this spear. The warrior impaled the spear through her own heart, with the hope of a honourable death. Upon this moment the force of her despair and love for battle tore the souls of the dead soldiers from their corpses and fused with the spear that had ended her life. Thousands and thousands of wraiths, ghosts, and spectres were drained into this mithril spear. Some say that the spear still lies in that same battlefield. Never claimed and forever cursed.<br />
<br />
The faint whispers of this legend tells us that the one who holds this spear in battle, may call an army of the dead, thousands of wraiths to fight by his/her side. The more willpower and will to survive and fight the wielder has, the more wraiths he/she will be able to summon. All who die by this spear will loose their souls to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Blazing_Hatred_b_'></a><h1><b>The Blazing Hatred</b></h1>
<br />
A blade forged of the flame of Vengeance. The blade itself is hidden by the Oracle of Fire<a href="" title="Create page: Oracle+of+Fire"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and what is known about the blade is very little. Legend tells us that the one who wields this blade, will gain control of fire, and the wielder may be able to call down meteors or create firestorms, or even launch fireballs to burn their foes. The blade is a monstrous two handed long sword and is burning with an everlasting flame, always in the shape of a sword.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Scourge_of_Reason_b_'></a><h1><b>Scourge of Reason</b></h1>
<br />
This powerful artifact is far from a weapon any child of light would wish to possess. Legends held by the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> state that it was created by the darkness itself. The scourge is made of 6 long lengths of leather, each tipped with a six-pronged hook believed to be of pure onyx stone. The handle itself is made of the same material and the pummel is adorned with a single black diamond. This weapon is believed to hold a variation of the Excoriate spell allowing the wielder to control the torture inflicted on his or her victim. It also uses the Nigredo spell to inflict mental anguish on the victim as well. Finally, if the person is killed while bound by the tongs of this weapon, there soul is sent to oblivion and traps it there to prevent their resurrection.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Fang_of_the_Dragon_b_'></a><h1><b>Fang of the Dragon</b></h1>
<br />
There was once a dragon of great evil, that wandered the lands of men. He destroyed all in his path, with fire, fang and claw. One day, a young man rose from the people. A man with lightning crackling down his fingertips, and the storms at his command. He and the dragon fought an epic battle, raging in the sky and on the earth. The young man was growng weak, and with the last of his strength he wished to see to it that the dragon would kill no more. He gathered together all of his power, and he sent a great bolt of lightning destroying himself as well as the dragon. But his sacrifice was in vain, for the dragon too had great power, and he had the arts to preserve his soul, until the day he could be free to roam the earth once more. It is said that a bolt of light fell to earth, in the center of a great forest, and that only one with true evil in his heart will ever master the cursed blade, without it devouring his soul.<br />
<br />
The sword has the power of air, but lightning crackles down it's mottled blue/black blade. It hilt is the head of a black dragon, wiith eyes of rubies that glitter with the evil and madness within. The two handed blade speaks into the mind of the bearer, whispering madness into his brain, if his madness is not already enough for the Black dragon.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Legendary_Bow_of_Estar_b_'></a><h1><b>Legendary Bow of Estar</b></h1>
<br />
Legends abound among those of Forest Elf ancestry, of a bow, forged of bronze and able to shoot an unending supply of bolts made of light itself. Though it is true that such a bow was created, much of the tale have been lost to the ages. What is know is that a powerful elven warrior name Valtúriyá Estár mastered the use of the bow so masterfully that a powerful wizard of Conjuration took note of his abilities. He offered him a bow that would never run out of arrows if he would join the fight against the growing darkness. The young forest elf accepted and received a beautiful bronze bow and used it until the day of his demise.<br />
<br />
The weapon has powerful invocations placed upon it allowing the bow to shoot bolts of light similar to that of the Light Arrows spell. It also cast a bright light, like that of the Lightbringer spell, around the wielder emanating from the artifact itself. It is said that if someone whose heart is not of light were to touch the bow a shower of meteors and comets, as evoked by the Celestial Rage spell, would destroy the person.<br />
<br />
The exact location of the bow is not known but it is believed to be where the warrior had fallen in The Ruins of Aether, although no one has yet found this powerful artifact.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Weapons_of_the_Chosen_b_'></a><h1><b>Weapons of the Chosen</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Daia_Ax_of_the_Chosen_b_'></a><h2><b>Daia'Ax of the Chosen</b></h2>
<br />
Make no mistake, a Daia'Ax is not an axe. It is a long, two handed straight blade with a curved tip. The Myth is that the Djinn of Swords, <a title="Toah" href='Toah.html' class='wiki'>Toah</a> will chose an apprentice from the best blacksmiths and warriors on earth, once every thousand years. This apprentice is taught to forge weapons more powerful than any mortal can wield, as long as the mortal uses this ability with righteousness and honour, and Balance.<br />
<br />
This apprentice is armed with the Daia'Ax, a medium wide, long, two handed sword which is imbued with the power of Light and Fire. The blade doesn't give it's wielder any powers, but the blade itself is a powerful and fast weapon. There are many weapons that are more powerful then thus but with skill, the wielder of this blade will will become a mighty warrior. The sword has a white handle, the blade is pure white - its metal not known by the mortals or immortal races of this world, and it burns with a white flame that never fades or falters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Reavers_of_the_Chosen_b_'></a><h2><b>Reavers of the Chosen</b></h2>
<br />
Two, two and a half feet long, wide edged blades imbued with light and ice, powerful weapons, which do not grant their wielder any other abilities. Carried alongside the Daia'Ax of The Chosen. Given by <a title="Toah" href='Toah.html' class='wiki'>Toah</a> personally.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Despair_b_'></a><h2><b>Despair </b></h2>
<br />
In the darkest void, and the most deepest dark was made a demon. This demon yields a blade, a blade more terrifying than death itself. The blade's very existence seeds fear and terror in the hearts of it's opponents. Only the strongest and most cold-blooded warriors can face this blade in combat. The blade is a monstrous two-handed long sword, covered by hardened tendons and veins on top of the black metal blade, dripping from the blood of it's victims. It will give it's wielder powers beyond imagination, empowered by the hate and despair of it's wielder. The hilt is made of solid bone. And as you have to have realised by now, this blade has been made from the remnants and body parts of men, elf, centaur, dwarf... This list can go on forever. The blade drains it's victim's power to itself, empowering the blade.<br />
<br />
But this blade also carries a curse: It slowly drains out the life force of the wielder. You must stop this to survive, you must slay, kill, and slaughter to keep this living blade satisfied. Bloodthirst, lust to slaughter, complete madness is this blade's curse.<br />
<br />
Nar'Zul'Diaar is chained as a prisoner under the Onyx City<a href="" title="Create page: Onyx+City"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The Obsidians necromancers guard and shackle him day and night. This demon wields Despair, the blade of terror. Slay the Obsidians, to release this demon, and then slay him, to yield this Blade!<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Fallen_Angel_b_'></a><h2><b>Fallen Angel</b></h2>
<br />
Jecht, a man of honour and valour. He was the one who delivered the word of the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> to mankind. He was also known as the Redeemer, before his apprentice ruined him in battle, yet unknown why. Jecht carried a bastard sword, which he named The Fallen Angel. The sword's blade swirls and twists like an attacking snake, inscribed with beautiful runes and markings, making the blade glow purely white in battle; It smoulders out of Justice, and Redemption.<br />
<br />
The blade imbues it's carrier with Jecht's soul, and his blessings; Empowering the wielders magical abilities with pure light, making every single spell to either purify, or ruin with the power of pure light. Every slash and cut the blade makes, will burn for an eternity in the victim's mind and soul. A wound this blade gives, will never be forgotten. In the handle reads: &quot;The Redeemer of Souls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Search the temples for his legacy. The monks and priests shall know, they WILL know. But remember, not all are worthy.<br />
