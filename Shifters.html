<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> A demon realm, their true location still widely unknown<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Unknown<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Their true appearance is unknown, they can morph and transform into almost anything they want, their powers of transformation are close to limitless. At death they simply evaporate, only the last second before they disappear will you see their true form. As these creatures are rare, their deaths are seen by a select few.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
The little that is known about shifters says that they are stoic people, often in the servitude of others, and extremely loyal to friends and masters. They will resent some aspects of their existence and with a few individuals their resentment has caused insanity and sadistic natures. Their nature to shift dictates that they do not stick around or keep people close. Their loyalties are born from their connection to their master, rather then love or respect. Outside of this relationship they would not think twice to kill anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Believed to be from the demon realms, coming into the Nether Realm through one of the Gates, Shifters History is non existent. Only a select few know their origins and those people are mostly Minions and Arcemedes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
They can transform into anything. For limits on the type of Shifter see Shifter Limits.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Shifter_Limits_b_'></a><h2><b>Shifter Limits</b></h2>
<br />
The Shifter Limits were a co-operative effort from members and staff at the forum - <a class="wiki"  href="http://www.thenetherrealm.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=3191&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=8656096">HERE</a>.<br />
<br />
Shifters are from a demon realm and thus in their realm they are literally limitless. When they come into the Nether Realm their powers are capped. The purity of their shifter blood will dictate their limits for the most part, a true shifter retaining most of their powers, and shifters who have mixed blood less and less so.<br />
<br />
When making a Shifter we ask that you give them limits and give you some freedom to be creative with those limits. Just bare the following in mind and have at least two of these or your own in you profile.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_True_Shifters_b_'></a><h3><b>True Shifters</b></h3>
<br />
These are Shifters who are full blooded Shifters and come from the Demon Realms.<br />
<br />
-very few actual limits<br />
-can't use the powers of those creatures that they imitate since they aren't truly that creature, but anything to do with the structure or body, such as eyesight, strength, poison, etc... can be borrowed by them<br />
-cannot replicate magical items or beasts except in appearance... see above<br />
-there is a certain amount of area that they can cover(any thoughts as to example of size appreciated) though it grows accordingly should they lose their density or spread their mass out (think solid, liquid and gas)<br />
-if they don't have a very good imagination, then they would probably be limited to actual things already in existence<br />
-able to mimic things like voice and communicate with other animals while in their form<br />
-as there is only one full language in TNR (Common Tongue) language is not really something a shifter would need to be able to imitate. But as true shifters have the ability to mimic this enables them to mimic talents, picking up dialects and communicating in their beast forms very quickly and easily<br />
-they can only communicate if they are in the correct form. for instance, to speak to dragons telepathically they have to have shifted into a dragon form, to speak to a wolf they have to be in wolf form, to develop a dwarvish accent they have to be in dwarf form.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Half_third_quarter_two_third_etc_Shifters_b_'></a><h3><b>Half/third/quarter/two-third/etc. Shifters</b></h3>
<br />
These are Shifters that are half races, and have diluted shifter blood.<br />
<br />
Mostly the same limits as true shifters with some notable exceptions.<br />
<br />
-concentration is key, lack of concentration means lack of coherency in shaping<br />
-communication with other creatures is far more difficult<br />
-require far more energy to shift or there is a limit to what/how many shapes they can shift into<br />
-can only shift into something they have already come across, they must have a memory of the creature or object in order to shift into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Player_s_choice_b_'></a><h3><b>Player's choice</b></h3>
<br />
These are things you can choose and are not limits per se. If you have further questions ask in the forums help section.<br />
<br />
-can or cannot keep their clothes<br />
-any other limits they player feels like adding to their own character<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Self_healing_healing_rate_b_'></a><h2><b>Self-healing/healing rate</b></h2>
<br />
<br />
Shifters carry an injury with them whatever their form. The truer the shifter the faster (and better) the healer.<br />
<br />
Fatal injuries drain the shifter, and some cannot be healed, but for smaller cuts, scrapes and bruises a shifter could change their shape to aid in healing (baring in mind the energy that goes into shifting and healing, you don't want to use up all your energy shifting and having nothing left for healing - but some shapes are easier to heal then other, the larger the better.)<br />
<br />
Healing is not as simple as looking at a cut and closing it up. The mind does not always make things so simple, since the shifter might believe that it can't be done since the pain is real and the injury is real. Or, since bodies are rather complex things, they might not know enough about the creature they are mimicking to heal the injury, and the pain is making it too distracted to shift to a more familiar form.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Sustenance_and_Energy_b_'></a><h2><b>Sustenance and Energy</b></h2>
<br />
Some shifters have the need to sustain their energy through food. This is something true shifters who are new to the realm are not effected by, and as time goes on and they cannot access the energy from their home realm they have a growing need to match their shifting rate by replacing the spent energy with food or something else (a potion perhaps). This is not a limit that is strictly applied to all shifters, as some may have a resistance or could have evolved to draw energy from a new source like NR's suns for instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Inanimate_Objects_b_'></a><h2><b>Inanimate Objects</b></h2>
<br />
Spending too long as a certain inanimate object makes them forget about who they are, simply because of the fact that an inanimate object has no memory. In some cases Shifters have spent so long as an inanimate object that they have forgotten how to shift and have remained in that state forever, or at least a very long time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Added_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Added Information</b></h1>
<br />
Most of the Shifters are believed to be in the servitude of Vampyres<a href="" title="Create page: Vampyres"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the slave traders of the <a title="Isles de Mortis" href='Isles+de+Mortis.html' class='wiki'>Isles de Mortis</a>.<br />
<br />
The truer the shifter the faster the learner<br />
