<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> They come from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, a small continent to the south west of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> The lifespan of the Zektens depends entirely on their class. Only kings and Queens of the Zektens are truly immortals in terms of time, even though illness and ageing doesn't cause any harm they can be killed by unnatural means. The Nobles are those who follow the king and queen in the lifespan length, these nobles are not immortals but they do have a very large lifespan, approximately 2000 years. Finally the minions,warriors and inspectors of these race have what it could be called a &quot;normal&quot; lifespan, more human like, 80-120 years is the average.<br />
<br />
<b>Religion:</b> In the beginning the used to worship Titan, sanctuaries and temples were built in his honour but as time passed by their faith on their creator started to fade. The temples now empty are only home to ghosts of other times to hunt, these temples are the scar of separation. Now they worship themselves as gods, statues and sanctuaries are now built in honour of the royal family of the Zektens.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Zektens are insect like. The Royal family is the one which has suffered the most changes allong history. They passed from being beautiful <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> to gigantic insecticide creatures. Their form resemblance the combination of spiders, beetles, moths and others.<br />
<br />
With gigantic jaws they crush their food. Two gigantic claws on their hands and feet.<br />
Their faces are mask like, these masks show their elfin faces but at the moment of attack or feeding the faces splits in half and shows their real face. Small green eyes in front of a nose less face with a gigantic mouth filled with even bigger teeth.<br />
<br />
The nobles have moth wings which reveals their status of Nobel and male, Nobel female have butterfly wings which also reveals their status. Both look much like elfs but with a grey skin and dark, long hair(if they have) with tree claws in each hand instead of the normal five fingers, their feet are mostly elfin with the exception they have claws en all five of them.<br />
<br />
Purple dots on their foreheads reveals their age, the more they have the older they are.<br />
<br />
Eyes are usually green but anomalies usually appear, some nobles have purple eyes which means they are more majick skilled than others, yellow eyes means they have great fighting skills.<br />
<br />
Nobles are usually beautiful creatures, with perfects features.<br />
<br />
Warriors are gigantic creatures, in average their high is 2,30 metres.<br />
<br />
Dark blue armour covers the entire body of these warriors, three claws instead of fingers, on their feet two gigantic claws on front.<br />
<br />
Small green eye which glows in the dark of the night.<br />
<br />
Older warriors have a pair of horns a the sides of their heads which they use as a natural weapon.<br />
<br />
During battle the mouth is covered with an armour but when feeding the armour fades and showing their crab like mouth and soft dark blue skin.<br />
<br />
Wings have turned into part of their armour which it &quot;separates&quot; on every joint of the body.<br />
<br />
Minions Are the most &quot;normal&quot; individuals on this race.<br />
<br />
They maintain most of their elfin image but they are hairless and with a &quot;brownish&quot; skin colour.<br />
<br />
Five fingers in each hands to manipulate tools.<br />
<br />
Their mouth is normal. Their eyes are fly like, big and green.<br />
<br />
A pair of fly wings appear on the backs of these minions long, transparent, thin but strong enough to lift them in the air and several kilos of whatever they have to carry.<br />
<br />
The minions are usually thin and large, with long arms and legs, older minions have two pairs of arms.<br />
<br />
The inspectors have to form of Centipedes, their upper torso is elfin like, the lower torso is on the form of centipedes.<br />
<br />
This centipedes part is about three metres long and with a hard carapace much like the warriors but instead of blue all around the body these inspectors are of green skin in the lower torso and grey skin on the upper side.<br />
<br />
Insect legs covers the centipede body, in their elfin body they have up to four arms.<br />
<br />
Short or long haired( depending on the Zektens personality),always black.<br />
<br />
Their faces are like normal elfs but with different eye colour, these Zektens have white eyes.<br />
Vampyre<a href="" title="Create page: Vampyre"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> fangs to bite their prey and long hard nails on their hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b> The Zektens are a very aggressive race, they live only to conquer and destroy. They aren't xenophobic, they like to blend with other races in order to improve themselves, this characteristic has been erased, they no longer mate with other species, they think they already are perfect this lead us to another one of their personality traits they are very trusted with their powers usually this have cost them great victories. Very cold, intelligent, vicious predators.<br />

<br />
 Long time ago <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> created His first sons, the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>. As these sons emigrated through all of the nether realm a curse was cast on to them. The <a title="darkness" href='darkness.html' class='wiki'>darkness</a> had cursed them with the fading which caused them to disappear taking away their greatest power, the power to beat death. Centuries passed and the effects of the curse where beginning to be &quot;noticeable&quot;. The firsts <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> were to die, two partners travelling to their union place, The Alumi Tree, in hope of obtaining a cure. Reaching their objective they were attacked by dark minions sent by the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> to hunt down the first male and female dyeing elves. The <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> where too tired due to the curse and stranded no chance against the demons, without their immortality they where killed. Using its powers in an intent to defy the light, in an intent to create another dark army the darkness used the corpses to create this new race, the Zektens where born from the corpses of two elves, Nameless.<br />
<br />
When <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> discovered the bodies his growl was heard all around the realm, with sadness he buried the elves at the shadow of the Alumi tree in hope they would find their path.<br />
<br />
As a defiance and mockery the newest sons of darkness saw the very first thing the sons of<br />
<a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> saw, The Great Alumi tree. They were born from the roots of the tree.<br />
Days later the corpses raised from their graves alarming every other elf that saw them dead, the great commotion they caused was more than enough to awake <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> from its slumber.<br />
<br />
Right away The elf creator saw the danger, the bad omen in this resurrection but being touched by seeing his children alive he cast a halt to this thought.<br />
<br />
For years Life continued as usual but changes started to manifest within the soul and body of these two walking corpses, a deep hunger forever unknown, physical changes appeared as well.<br />
<br />
They where stronger, faster than a normal elf until one day slumber attacked and the changes appeared to stay.<br />
Confused they returned to the only place they knew as safe, The Alumi tree, in hypnotics movements they fell asleep under its shadow. And thus it began. The infusion of the dark soul they had received started to transform them into their true form. Turning into foetal position blood started to pour from their skin creating a cocoon.<br />
After days they woke up to find they had changed not only in their image but also in mind.<br />
<br />
Seeing <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> still as a god but deep in their minds they just saw him as a piece of moving rock.<br />
<br />
<a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> horrified by the sight of this insecticidal <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> decided to separate them from the others by creating a forest for them to live imprisoned convincing them to leave promising they would be remembered <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> made these now Zektens leave their land.<br />
<br />
For years the lived in the forest changing beyond recognition, reproducing, infesting.<br />
Years later the first two dared to leave the forest in order to see their god but all what they found was deception, their god had forgotten them.<br />
<br />
Back in the forest a decision had to be made, to live in darkness in the forest or to defy their now false god Titan and leave. Deliberations did not took long, their children accepted the order and that's how the &quot;great Emigration&quot; began.<br />
<br />
Dozens of Zektens left the forest and ran free all around elfins lands, this provoked the wrath of <a title="titan" href='titan.html' class='wiki'>titan</a> who cast them out of this land making them live in a forgotten land, much like the elfin ones but great dangers lived in those forests.<br />
<br />
Centuries passed by and the Zekten empire now divided itself into several clans all around nether realm in order to conquer, like a swarm they attack and consume, to prove they are not a failure race.<br />
<br />
Being the <a title="Obsidian elves" href='Obsidian+elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian elves</a> also naturals enemies of the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> they joined forces in more than one opportunity in order to invade and destroy the elfin lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
</div><a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
As sons of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> and the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> they are aligned to earth and Dark majick (mostly dark, because inside of them they have a part of the dark lord itself). Their use of magic is limited to nobles and royal families, the minions and warriors do not inherit this ability.<br />
<br />
They believe their magic is for destruction and conquer of others and protection of the hive.<br />
In the early ages of this race their magic only included the powers of the forest elves but as they lost contact on Titan their powers evolved in different paths.<br />
<br />
Their true origins gives them the ability to master Dark spells, Dark spells are for the only use of Royal family, the nobles only have access to earth powers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Added_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Added Information</b></h1>
<br />
In spite of looking like mindless beasts at the moment of war behind their parasite like empire its hidden a complicated social structure.<br />
<br />
The King and Queen are on top of the evolutionary line, they are the most powerful Zektens in the whole realm, capable of unspeakable things. They have given birth to countless sons.<br />
<br />
Then we have the different sons of this royal family, these kids are known as the Nobles they share most of the powers of their parents and they command the different clans, only the most skilled nobles are selected to rule over the clans, less skilled nobles are to obey/help the noble they are teamed with.<br />
After the Nobles we can find what they call Generals, these generals can be either warrior or inspectors. They are chosen as generals after they reach maturity and have accomplished certain duties, most generals are of trust for the Nobel who chose them. The generals are very skilled warriors and the often lead the armies.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of this line we have the minions and normal ranked warriors and inspectors who have no other choice but to obey the orders of the nobles and generals.<br />
<br />
The minions build, the warriors fight, inspectors spy and fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Weaknesses_b_'></a><h2><b>Weaknesses</b></h2>
<br />
-All Zektens have a strong weakness for sweet scents. If the smell is strong enough the Zektens became hypnotised by it and ergo vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<br />
-Each time they evolve the are vulnerable during this state of evolution.<br />
<br />
-Even though they have metal like exo-skeletons they are very vulnerable on the joints of their limbs.<br />
<br />
-They are very vulnerable to the fruits of the Alumi tree. Weapons have been made from these tree to fight the Zektens, a slash of a weapon made of a branch of the Alumi tree; if it strikes in their heart or chest can kill any Zekten, other hits only hurt them deeply.<br />
<br />
<a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> have used majick shields based on this fruit to protect their land. This shield works as long as the fruit is fresh, when rotten the effects of the shield just disappear.<br />
<br />
-Only the King and Queen can reproduce, this ability has been suppressed by the royal family to avoid stronger children.<br />
<br />
If they die it is most likely this species would slowly die.<br />
<br />
-For them Human or elfin appearance among teenagers or adults is considered a weaknesses<br />
<br />
-Cold temperatures slow warriors down and make their skin very fragile, crystal like.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Physical_powers_b_'></a><h2><b>Physical powers</b></h2>
<br />
-Zektens are born from eggs looking like forest elves with the difference they have dark hair and a pair of purple dots on their forehead. As the Zekten grows older, in case of nobles, they go through three stages of change:<br />
<br />
-Childhood to teenage.( At the moment of their birth they are an exact copy of a forest elf, the only difference is their dark hair, the green eyes and the purple dots on their foreheads)<br />
-Teenage to adulthood(they stop ageing in this stage until they are 1500 years old, they retain the appearance of a 20 year old like a normal elf)<br />
-Adulthood in this stage the ageing accelerates and how much they live in this part of their life depends entirely on their parents.<br />
Warriors and inspectors also evolve but only from childhood to adulthood.<br />
Inspectors are born with their centipede lower torso.<br />
<br />
-Each evolution takes up to 1 month.<br />
<br />
-Thanks to their Titan heritage they can rapidly heal their wounds, the older the Zekten the faster they heal. Nobles and Royal family being the faster healers.<br />
<br />
-Magic can be passed on by the Queen to their children, she can only do this with the ones she chooses before birth to be Nobles.<br />
<br />
-The King decides which son have the power of immortality, he only gives this power to Noble children.<br />
<br />
-The children are in a way genetically designed by the parents, they decide which gene goes in which kid so they can have an even greater control on every kid they make.<br />
<br />
-The royal family( as you can see) decides which kid is a noble, a minion, warrior or inspectors.<br />
<br />
-They reproduce via eggs which are laid by the Queen after mating with the King. These eggs take from 6 to 9 months to hatch depending if they are hatching Noble children (9 month) or a servant/warrior/inspector's (6 months).<br />
<br />
-Every Zekten has the same level of &quot;intelligence&quot;. Noble kids share a telepathic union which is never used for jealousy between clans. This telepathic link depends entirely on distance, if too close of each other nobles can read each others minds which has turned up to be an annoyance among the nobles.<br />
These power has been kept in order to maintain the clans separated and therefore more docile for the Royal Family to control.<br />
<br />
-Warrior Zektens have a metal like exo-skeleton's, much like the Aluka but this armour covers their whole body.<br />
<br />
They don't have bones so this exo-skeleton's his much harder than Aluka's in order to support the great strain that their bodies generate.<br />
<br />
In the case of Inspectors they have the same exo-skeleton's of the warriors on their centipedes limbs, their upper torso is has hard as any other minion.<br />
<br />
They have tender joints in order to be mobile, minions have human skin only a bit harder.<br />
<br />
Nobel's don't have such a strong skin due to the simple reason they have very hard bones, arrows and sword slashes at some degree can be avoided thanks to this rock-skin.<br />
Royal family has both.<br />
<br />
-Warriors depend only on their physical powers to fight so they have developed a very powerful body in order to compensate for the lost of magical powers.<br />
<br />
For example an elephantine strength among others.<br />
<br />
-Each time Zektens evolve they enhance their abilities. Evolution depends also on the class:<br />
Nobles evolve three times while the warriors/minions only evolve two times.<br />
The Royal family is on eternal evolution for one reason: they're immortals.<br />
<br />
-As every other insect they can climb every surface, except holy ones or the ones protected by light majick which burns them at touch.<br />
<br />
-The Nobles and minions have wings, very different of course from the warriors and inspectors, who don't.<br />
<br />
-Warriors have on their arms poisonous stingers which they use as swords, the poison never kills just stun.<br />
<br />
-They communicate through noise during battle in order to confuse, older elves have learned their battle language and use it against them giving different orders to confuse the Zektens, works only in young warriors.<br />
<br />
-High jumps can be performed thanks to their high level of strength.<br />
<br />
-They can survive long periods under water but most Zektens are most likely to die.<br />
<br />
-Minions have fly like reflexes so they can work much faster than other creatures.<br />
Thanks to this power they are hard to kill.<br />
<br />
-Inspectors are very fast which is why the are used for spying.<br />
<br />
-They have a pair of stings at the bottom of their centipede tail, which have no poison.<br />
<br />
-These centipedes limbs are very strong, its most likely that instead of fighting with their upper torso the use these limbs as attack and defence.<br />
<br />
-Inspectors have the unique power of night vision for spying.<br />
