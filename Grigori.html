PERSONALITY: Grigori is outwardly a quiet man, polite and well versed in the etiquette of simple, reasonable interaction. He will speak no ill word of anyone of particular importance; at least, not in public. He has worked to gain a reputation as an advocate of peace and unity within Avalon and so often appears diplomatic and open-minded to all. However, the snap in his voice and the often stern look he lays upon those who disturb his calm serenity can reveal more of his real character, if the right person picks up on the lie in his voice. He rarely ever shows his anger and always seem to have tight control of whatever situation he encounters or room he walks into.<br />
<br />
BACKSTORY: A man of Sovereign Ravencloud’s court, Grigori has a very influential grasp on Sedana – more so than is obvious as he has yet to reveal or proclaim himself. Little is, or can be known about him. Most records of him have mysteriously disappeared and the ones that exist now have all been brought into existence with his permission, and his alone; though this is known by very few people.<br />
<br />
He has autonomy throughout Sedana and despite his political position, he can be as dangerous in a fight as he is with his pen. Very few people ever oppose him and yet this too is not so obvious as he rarely ever flexes his political muscle in any obvious way. A man of subtlety, Grigori is clearly powerful from one point and yet a mere shadow in the court from another point. He has worked tirelessly for years to gain such a standing and it cannot be wrestled from him easily, if at all.<br />
