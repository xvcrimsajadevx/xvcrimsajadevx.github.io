<br />
A long ago, a fierce warrior, Drugh The Manslayer, conquered many battlefields, and slaughtered hundreds of innocents. At first his blade and hand were driven by honour, and lust for noble deeds, glory at the most. His father was a honourable man, and his desire was to follow his fatherâ€™s footprints. But it was not soon, that all the bloodshed, anger and despair gave him madness. Soon he became known as the malicious, Drugh the Manslayer, for his brutality and merciless tactics. His name was feared in the Eastern Continent, and even across the seas.<br />
<br />
Drugh wore a plate armour, forged and hammered by the most skilled and experienced Dwarf blacksmith ever seen. It was made out of Ebony, a rare metal found in the depths of the mountains.<br />
Drugh wield the armour with rage and wrath, binding in his fury and anger to the cold steel. This relic of war was taken to his grave, after his fall in battle. His grave is hidden somewhere in Kalimdor, where no mortal can find it. The battle gear contains; Gauntlets, Bracers, A belt, Shoulderguards, a cuirass, helmet, leg guards, and sabatons.<br />
The armour is black, with yellow markings on it. The armour is worn out.<br />
<br />
It has been told that the mortal who carries this battle gear can take more wounds than a normal mortal, and will be blessed with the Endurance and Strength of the Dreadnought.<br />
<br />
But the armour comes with a burden. The one who wields these, may never remove them, until Death devours their carrier. The armour drains out the life force of their carrier, slowly. To stop this temporarily, and gain back his or her strength, the carrier must sacrifice 10 living creatures to Morrigan, the Djinn of War.<br />

<br />
From the lands of the Nyoryns comes a legend of a knight of light. This armor glowed like the light of the noonday a glistened like a polished stone. According to these tales, seven men interred their land each wearing the grandest armor any had ever seen. Although the armor appeared to be made of the finest steel, light emanated from them as if they were lanterns. It is said that even in the darkest night this glow lit up the area around them and pushed back the impinging darkness. They traveled the land seeking justice and light until they had rid the region of those whose deeds brought darkness to their land.<br />
<br />
As with most myths there is a nugget of truth hidden within these tales. There were indeed seven knights wearing armor of light. However, as for ridding all those whose deeds were of darkness, this is an exaggeration. These suites of full armor were endued with the Lightbringer spell allowing light to shine forth from them in about a 20-foot radius. As the light became farther from them it would be dispersed by the surrounding darkness. The light was also not a bright as the tales would have us believe but still sufficient to add an air of authority to those wearing the armor and light the area surrounding them so they could see an attacker. Also, the armor has been enchanted with the glamour spell. This allows the wearer to appear more handsome, or beautiful than they would normally be. Included in the armor is another enchantment, an adaptation of the spell Wall making the armor more effective against both majickal and non-majickal attack.<br />
<br />
Those of darkness destroyed much of this armor. Only portions of it are believed to exist scatter about the realm. As there whereabouts are unknown, many have set out in search of this armor and have come back empty handed. I truth there is a whole set of this armor believed to be safely hid among the peoples of <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a>. It is believed that the king knows of where it has been secured and will bestow it upon the deserving warrior when he or she is revealed. There are also rumors that other pieces of it still exist in various locations although these rumors cannot be verified.<br />
