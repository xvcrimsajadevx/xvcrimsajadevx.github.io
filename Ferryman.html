<a name='_b_Origins_b_'></a><h1><b>Origins</b></h1>
<br />
I shall tell you of the origins of the Ferryman, not because this knowledge is written down in the temple of Apollyon, nor because it is told in stories by the Necra to their young. No, I shall tell you because you already know his origins. It may not be in the front of your mind, in your conscious thoughts... it is not something you may want to admit you know. We know the face of Death as well as we know the faces of our mothers. For it is his face we see in the distance, his Ferry that awaits us when this life is spent. We know where he came from, what his purpose is, we know... and we fear.<br />
<br />
In the beginning humes did not die. The Nether Realm was untouched by Darkness and humes were destined to live forever. When the curse fell upon humes and they became mortal the Djinn Apollyon became the Lord of Oblivion, the realm of the dead. He was, in the very beginning, neutral. His purpose was to tend Oblivion and maintain the balance of the dead and living and to keep them separate. He tarried not in the Nether Realm, he preferred the void of Oblivion. So he needed a being to claim the souls of humes and bring them to him.<br />
<br />
As death and grief gripped the world humes found themselves reassessing their lives and purpose. They were doomed to die, and some did not accept this. One man, a simple man, a man in love, cared not for this new phenomenon. As love as he was with his lover nothing else mattered in this world. So when she was taken from his, when death claimed her, he was consumed by his grief. He sought the Lord of the Dead, bellowed his name from the highest mountain and demanded that he return his love to him.<br />
<br />
Apollyon heard. He appeared and he offered the man a bargain. &quot;Your soul for hers...&quot;<br />
<br />
He would give her life if the man give him his soul. &quot;When she dies again your soul will be mine. You wish lose your humanity and hers will be the first soul you bring to me in Oblivion. And for eternity your duty will be to usher all the souls of the dead to Oblivion, to guide them to the river of souls and to maintain the flow of life and death between this world and Oblivion.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man accepted and his lover was returned to him. Whole. This joy did not last long though and a few months later he returned home to their stone cottage to find her slaughtered. As soon as his eyes settled upon her corpse his own body started to change. His flesh fell away, his eyes disappeared and he was soon nothing more then a skeleton. As he changed the world changed. It took upon itself a grey hue, shadows came alive and he realised, he was no longer in just the Nether Realm, he was in Oblivion too. It was then he saw her, the spirit of the woman he had sold his soul for. She was lost, afraid, and he was there, ready to take her to the next world. It was then he realised his sacrifice had been worth it. Just a few more months with her for his soul... and then the rest of eternity he would be able to pull her from the river of the dead and speak with her.... look at her with the ghosts of his eyes.<br />
<br />
He took her hand and was not surprised to see a Ferry appear by his side. In it was a pole and a robe. He put on the black robe which covered his skull and his body. As he grabbed the pole only his skeletal hands were exposed, but she seemed not to care. She saw him, he knew, as he was in life. When they came to the river she smiled knowingly. He did not want to let her go but knew that he had no choice. She sank through the boat, and joined the rest of the souls whom had passed since the Darkness had cursed humankind.<br />
<br />
He watched as she drifted away, knowing he would always be able to find her again, he was the Ferry man and the Ferryman was the Guardian of this place, and would be able to spot her golden aura and sense her beautiful spirit no matter where she was in Oblivion. As the centuries passed, then a millennia, he noticed the golden aura change. She was becoming less then she had been in life, losing herself, this world of Darkness was tainting her. His grief returned and his fury simmered. And when Apollyon turned and joined the Darkness, becoming a Thyrza he knew, the Djinn had orchestrated it all.<br />
<br />
The Ferryman remains faithful to his duty and Apollyon commands him not. Almost six thousand years have passed and his heart is still as raw as it was when he first lost his lover.  His hate for the Djinn has grown but he is biding his time, waiting, watching and plotting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
All that most see of the Ferryman are his bony hands, his long fingers gripping the wooden pole he uses to push the ferry and his black robes. Occasionally one may glimpse sight of his skull, and some claim to have seen a fire burning in the empty sockets where his eyes once were. He his about 6'5'', as tall as he was in life.<br />

<a name='_b_Nature_b_'></a><h1><b>Nature</b></h1>
<br />
The Ferryman exists both in the spirit world of Oblivion and in the Nether Realm. His essence bridges across worlds, his physical self ferrying people back and forth from Apollyon's Temple, his spirit ushering hume souls to Oblivion. He is sympathetic and kind to lost souls, trying to ease the transition to the river of the dead. Although reluctant to talk to the dead he will answer three questions, no more, and no less.<br />
<br />
In the Lake of the Dead he sees all the souls of those who have passed. Most who cross on his ferry fear the waters, seeing the odd corpse under the water, vacant expressions staring back up at them. The Ferryman searches for <a class="wiki"  href="i">i</a>her<a class="wiki"  href="/i">/i</a> face though, and when he sees it it eases his soul and he relaxes.<br />
<br />
He resents his existence, but will not abandon his duty. He is still able to see his lost love and he believes he is the only thing standing between the Darkness and Apollyon's corruption and the Light in the souls of Humes.<br />
<br />
He helps wizards finds the soul they need to restore it to the resurrected body and any other being of Light and goodness will have his aid. However, he hinders necromancers and hates them, and will try and keep them in Oblivion if they breach his domain.<br />
<br />
If he stops being the Ferryman he will no longer exist. His soul is tied to his role and when he stops being the ferryman he stops being.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Purpose_b_'></a><h1><b>Purpose</b></h1>
<br />
His purpose is twofold;<br />
<br />
- Ferries souls of the dead humes to Oblivion.<br />
- Ferries the living to and from Apollyon.<br />
<br />
He sails upon his ferry in Oblivion, the vast, black void in which the golden and black river of souls flows. Whilst pushing his ferry along in the spirit world he flicks in and out, disappearing to take a soul from near a body and bring it to oblivion, taking them in his ferry. He then tells them they must enter the river, that this is their last stop, and they leave him and take their place, flowing amongst the dead.<br />
<br />
He believes that Apollyon has corrupted death and he sees necromancy as tampering with it too. He abhors this interference, and works diligently ushering souls alive and dead, to and from Apollyon.<br />
