Shalimdor (Quiet Lands)<br />
<br />
Located in the north west of the Eastern Continent, the Quiet Lands are peaceful and the only area of the northern region of this continent with a coastline of beaches. The land ends at the foothills of the Umikabi Mountains, the mountain range cutting off these plains from the rest of the land. There is no way to the other side of the mountains as Umikabi has no mountain passes. The Druids of <a title="Omri" href='Omri.html' class='wiki'>Omri</a> have dwelt in these lands for millennia, its peace and tranquillity perfect for their meditation and the forests the homes of their people.<br />
