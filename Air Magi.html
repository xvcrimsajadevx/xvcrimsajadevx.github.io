Only the deepest emotions can cause an aeromancer to succumb to air, but it does happen. Their connection with the element of air is deeply profound and something they cannot understand themselves. Air is the hardest element to master and those that do tend to use it to control the weather more then anything. It is a difficult thing to do and requires much study and skill.<br />
<br />
Those who end up as Aero Magi's either have a massive amount of control and aptitude for this element, or are deeply spiritual and lose themselves in it, desiring to become like a ghost, like the air and exist as a thought and a whisper only.<br />
