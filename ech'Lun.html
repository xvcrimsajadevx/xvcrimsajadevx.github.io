<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Malikar<a href="" title="Create page: Malikar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, in the north-east of the Eastern continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> The average ech'Lun lives to between 160 and 240 years. None have lived longer than 267.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance: </b>Wolf mixed with humanoid features.<br />
<br />
<i>At first glance a man with the body, coat, facial structure and at times tail of a wolf, the ech’Lun appear to be werewolves. However, at a more detailed look their fashion of walking and choice, at times, to walk flat footed rule out this possibility; they hold much more control of their actions and have enough physical differences to show more of an even merge with the human form. Therefore, they are clearly more than beasts. Then again, their clothing is something of a hint also!</i><br />

<br />
Hazar Shual created a merge of humans and his beloved Shual, and as such the ech’Lun have physical features from both races.<br />
<br />
The long, powerful muzzle is prominent. The maxilla has six incisors, two canines, eight premolars, and four molars, whilst the mandible has six incisors, two canines, eight premolars, and six molars. The fourth upper premolars and first lower molars constitute the carnassial teeth, which are essential tools for shearing flesh. Although, their jaws have subtle differences to that of a wolf so that speech in the common tongue is possible. Eye colour can vary, depending upon tribe (see: clans of the ech’Lun). Each ech’Lun has the physical ability to make sounds from their throats that only other ech’Lun could understand; not a language exactly, but only common to the ech’Lun.<br />
<br />
Their ears are like that of a wolf, permanently &quot;standing&quot; as it were.<br />
<br />
They commonly stand as humans, however some choose not to (once again, see: clans of the ech’Lun). Their upper torso - specifically the chest and stomach - can be well built muscle-wise or not, depending upon each individual and sometimes which clan (see: clans of the ech’Lun). But all do have powerful backs, unless they are majickally powerful (see: Kar’sae info), even if their upper torso is not particularly well built. Their legs are that of the hybrid between human<a href="" title="Create page: human"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Shual<a href="" title="Create page: Shual"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> - though they are biped in nature, they have very strong legs for running and stamina. Their feet are padded, yet long like a human<a href="" title="Create page: human"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Their hands are slightly longer than humans in length, yet they do have four fingers and an opposable thumb. Retractable claws are a feature individual to the ech’Lun, yet they are used rarely as it is not recognised by the book of Time as natural (and therefore a gift of Hazar Shual).<br />
<br />
Females have tails, males do not. They are well kept as it is seen as shameful for it to be bushy or wild in any fashion. The only time this is acceptable is when the female is pregnant….<br />
<br />
<i>When the females become pregnant, they move to one of the many Sanctuaries (rough translation - initially translated as trees of life force which makes little sense) they have and do not return for nearly eight years. Though this is at first quite alarming, I have been informed that the Sanctuaries are communities in themselves which the fathers visit quite often. Where they are however, what they look like and what exactly happens in them is quite the mystery as they are as fiercely protected as the temples.</i><br />

<br />
The ech’Lun have the fur of a wolf, much like werewolves which they maintain and fashion as they see fit; this could be for various reasons, from religion to something as simple as fashion (especially for younger ech’Lun and some females). The colour of fur can range from dark colours to light and everything in between. Black and white are rare colours for fur and seen as symbolic; many of the Shual are believed to have had pure white fur, whilst the rak’Shual have pure black.<br />
<br />
Though they wear clothes, the ech'Lun do not need to cover their bodies wholly like the Priests of their God or most other humans. Instead, loincloths are popularly worn by most, if not all, ech'Lun most of the time as they are seen as decent; as mentioned by Miranda Cothel the ech'Lun are NOT mere beasts. Most females also wear cloth that covers their chest and some even wear more, due to either religion or fashion. Other clothing includes gauntlets (on both arms and/or legs), various robes depending upon religion or status (for example, a member of government), jewellery (this can be many different things - earrings, necklaces, bracelets, clasps, pins, buckles - and all in different styles) worn for various reasons such as symbolism (and therefore religion), majickal protection and even practicality when extra clothing is worn. Some ech'Lun even attach jewellery to their weapons.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
 Many of the ech'Lun are aggressive, protective of their land and their clan and can be prone to angry reactions to intrusions from the Outside world.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
Due to their strong affinity with nature, the ech'Lun have majick at their disposal that is particularly powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Tribes_b_'></a><h1><b>The Tribes</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
There are four tribes within the ech'Lun territories, which span across the Rathrabin jungle, the Tribal lands and onto the edges of the canyon lands.<br />
<br />
The four tribes are:<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Kea_til_ech_Lun_b_'></a><h2><b>Kea'til ech'Lun</b></h2>
<br />
Kea'til ech'Lun are the Keepers of the clans, always maintaining peace and ambassadors to the world. They are the most adaptable to the outside world and considered the most human-like of the four tribes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Kaa_mul_ech_Lun_b_'></a><h2><b>Kaa'mul ech'Lun</b></h2>
<br />
Kaa'mul are the strongest battle allies of the Kea'til and considered the fiercest natural warriors of the tribes. They live to some of the oldest ways of the ech'Lun and wish only to maintain traditions. They favour water more than the other tribes and maintain an uneasy peace with the Kar'sae.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Kol_fea_ech_Lun_b_'></a><h2><b>Kol'fea ech'Lun</b></h2>
<br />
Kol'fea are the most war-like of the tribes and the only tribe to border the most wild canyons. They are also the only tribe to accept various weaponry from the outside world - this can range from broadswords to bows and even such weapons as chain maces. Their clans are only ever united by war and are male dominated in an oppressive fashion. Those that survive battles are often scared for life. This harsh and vengeful tribe are under suspicion from the other tribes of having been infiltrated by the Darkness.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Kar_sae_ech_Lun_b_'></a><h2><b>Kar'sae ech'Lun</b></h2>
<br />
Kar'sae are the librarians of the ech'Lun, historians for this ancient society. They are learned and pursue the knowledge of their race, the records of the old ways. They keep to their own territories more so than the Kaa'mul or Kea'til and as such are seen as a reclusive tribe.<br />
<br />
This tribe is split into two types of ech'Lun: those born for combat and those born for the learned ways of the tribe. Those born for combat are bigger at birth and grow to become bodyguards of their learned brethren, whilst the others are born to become the so-called librarians and historians. Of the learned Kar'sae come the majick users; these are very powerful and highly respected, but are balanced out by a severe lack of physical power compared to their fellow ech'Lun.<br />
<br />
The learned ech'Lun pursue the ancient records of Hazar Shual and their ancestors, which can include majicks, artifacts, traditions, rituals and city infrastructures ... The knowledge of the foundations of ech'Lun society. There is also a fervent search for the most ancient secrets of their God (Hazar Shual) and his priests, which the elder scribes believe are important in regards to the doom.<br />
