<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Ny'eki (They were originally one entity, one people, one evolved sub race, and called Ny'eki by the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>. When they fell they split into two, the Ny Tribe and the Eki Tribe. They unite under the one name, Ny'eki, in honour of their origins but they are very different tribes)<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Near the Abyss, DC.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Same as <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a><br />
<br />
<b>Religion:</b> Worship the dark entity they call Apala'puyallu, literally meaning shadow (A-PALL-a) creature (POO-YALL-oo)<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Ny_tribe_b_'></a><h2><b>Ny tribe</b></h2>
<br />
 5% of the Ny'eki population.<br />
<br />
They are as humanoid looking as the Alatus are, they suffered less of a taint from the Abyss and thusly because of their humanoid features raise themselves above the Eki. Black feathered wings, look like <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> but with darker skin, deeply tanned almost black skin. Heavily tattooed, white tribal markings on the face and all over the body, depends on the individual, some have more or less - the more they are tattooed the older they are. After each rite of passage they add more body decoration, including piercings. Average height is between 5'4 and 5'9. Ny can range from weak and frail bodied to toned and fit. Their social caste is defined by the state of their wings, the more well kept and silken the higher the cast. Some of the lower Ny have a cross between bat like wings and feathered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Eki_tribe_b_'></a><h2><b>Eki tribe</b></h2>
<br />
 95% of the Ny'eki population<br />
<br />
Bat-like black wings, demonic features - such as - flat, pale face, horned chins, large pointed ears, long thin fingers that are tipped with talon like nails. Generally very tall and muscular, and tend to often be in a very fit condition due to their harsh environment and need to survive. Their lives offer no comfort to them and they are shaped by the terrain, the unforgiving pits and fumes and are scarred by the geysers that shoot putrid acid from the bowels of the earth. Other battle scars are showed with pride, honour scars that prove they are stronger then the Eki they defeated. They are forced to live in the mountainous cavern regions and in the hills and on the plains whilst the Ny tribes have the cover of the ruined cities and live on the outside edges of the Abyss. The Eki epitomize the survival of the fittest, only the strongest live.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h1><b>Personality Traits</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Ny_b_'></a><h2><b>Ny</b></h2>
<br />
Very intelligent, manipulative of the Eki, they treat the Eki as they believe they were once treated by the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>. Arrogant and have chips on their shoulders, they inherit the grudge against the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> as they are taught from birth to hate them for casting them out of <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>. They believe they are a superior evolution of the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> and are the rightful heirs to the city. They are jealous of one another, competitive and seek power over each other, the Eki and the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>. They would not think twice about disposing of another Ny to gain an advantage in their tribalistic society. many of the Ny of the upper castes are vain and will not associate with those lower then them unless they are their slaves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Eki_b_'></a><h2><b>Eki</b></h2>
<br />
Bestial, aggressive, simple minded due to their devolution and deranged minds. They are quick to anger and see combat as the only solution to all problems. They are suppressed by their Ny brethren and succumb to their will easily, not even the most intelligent Eki see this as unusual or wrong. Their servitude is inherent, inborn, inbred and inane. Many Eki are born with a need to serve the Ny and those that do disobey are thrown into the Abyss. However they do have a sense of honour, although it is complicated and twisted.<br />
<br />

<a name='History_'></a><h1>History:</h1><a id="flipperid852679" class="link" href="javascript:flipWithSign('id852679')">[+]</a><div id="id852679" style="display:none;">
<br />
The Ny'eki evolved early on in <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> history and were at first downcast and down trodden by their fairer cousins, cast out of normal <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> society and forced into the slums of the city. Their nefarious culture and attitudes and actions towards each other and slum dwelling <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> were the beginning of the end for them. They were forced to be slaves, were second class citizens, abhorred and despised. It was not until an uprising in the Slums, where many <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> died and many Ny'eki ravaged the city in their rage that the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> finally threw them out of their city permanently. Then they were thrown out and cast down into the Abyss. Those Ny'eki that survived the fall formed a society. The Eki are those who fell first and furthest into the Abyss and were changed by the darkness therein. The Ny those who managed to fly away and crash into the dark lands on the borders of the Abyss. Here they found a ruined city, and there they based their society and live in a tribalistic manner to this day.<br />
<br />
In the intervening period the Ny'eki have not progressed as a society. The intelligent Ny are hell bent on revenge and have sent wave after wave of attacks on <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a>. But each attack was wiped out, the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> using the weather Device<a href="" title="Create page: Device"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> to decimate the Eki in the skies. Every time enough Eki are available the Ny send another wave.<br />
<br />
However, since the ascension of As'ang<a href="" title="Create page: As%27ang"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> the Ny have been more subtle with their attacks. They use subterfuge, blackmail and recently, kidnap. The Ny'eki are the ones who took Ophelia<a href="" title="Create page: Ophelia"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, but it was not their idea. They were promised the Device<a href="" title="Create page: Device"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> as a reward and are angry they have not received it. They need the Device<a href="" title="Create page: Device"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> to take control of the City, and to stop the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> from taking out their forces again. They are planning on taking control of <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> using <a title="Shala Ayperi" href='Shala+Ayperi.html' class='wiki'>Shala Ayperi</a> (the daughter of <a title="Seluci Ayperi" href='Seluci+Ayperi.html' class='wiki'>Seluci Ayperi</a>, the High Seat of House Ayperi, one of the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> high nobles) and crashing the floating city into their ruined land and enslaving the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>.<br />
<br />
As'ang<a href="" title="Create page: As%27ang"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> has bewitched Shala into believing they will rule together, and she foolishly believes him.<br />

<br />
 It is unknown what their powers are. They do not appear to have any, but they are constantly evolving biologically if not socially so it is possible they have untapped abilities.<br />
<br />
However, when they devolved on <a title="Volatilis" href='Volatilis.html' class='wiki'>Volatilis</a> they did not develop any air majicks, and therefore were seen as less then the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>, that and their black wings marked them apart from the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>. They show no aptitude for the element, and only their wings mark them as a creation of the Air Origin. If they have majick, they do not use it, or do not know how to. It is likely the Air Origin has blocked their inherent powers (possibly because of their society drifting too far from the Light) or they lost them when they devolved.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
 Tribal names have accents and apostrophes.<br />
<br />
The prince of the Ny'eki (both tribes bow to him) is As'ang, who took power after his elder brother went missing.<br />
