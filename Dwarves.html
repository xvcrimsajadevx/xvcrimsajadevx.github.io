<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Country_Region_b_'></a><h2><b>Country/Region:</b></h2>
<br />
<a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>, south east of the Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Capital City of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, a city built in, around and on a volcano. There are several nomadic tribes of dwarves, and finding lone roaming dwarves is not uncommon. Also, there are several mining outposts, and colonies dotting around <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
They have mines all over the Nether Realm and trade their weapons and magical items for gold gold gold!! The dwarves of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a> have a close relationship with the Wizarding head of Alchemy.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lifespan_b_'></a><h2><b>Lifespan:</b></h2>
<br />
Dwarves are an immortal race, but because of the curse of the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> they are not infallible. They can be killed in battle, and can succumb to a deadly disease they call Dwarf's Bane. None know the cause and many have searched the Nether Realm for a cure. It begins to afflict Dwarves at around 500. It is a slow illness and many dwarves do not survive past 900. There is only one place in the Nether Realm where dwarves can truly live out their immortal lives, and that is in Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the Mountains of Hope<a href="" title="Create page: Mountains+of+Hope"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are considered adult around 35, but several adventurous ones have left as early as 25.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h2><b>Appearance:</b></h2>
<br />
Short, stocky humans. Ranging from three feet, to four and a half feet tall, dwarves are always broad and stocky. They can range in skin color from fair to a deep grey. Hair color tend to follow suit with skin hue, and can range the spectrum of colours. Lighter looking dwarves have generally been born away from Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The dwarves there tend to be very dark. Also, all male dwarves wear a beard that is a status symbol.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h2><b>Personality Traits:</b></h2>
<br />
Dwarves tend to be very stubborn and loyal. The race is very warlike, but excels in peace as well. Creators of outstanding armour and weapons, they are also proficient in their use. They tend to distrust other races, but they allow them to come and trade. Dwarves also carry a natural wanderlust. Most get this out of their system when they are young to avoid the Dwarf Bane, but several ignore it and live their lives abroad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
Dwarves are very resistant to magic. The only expression of magic in this race is in their item creation. Every once in a great while, a dwarf portrays the qualities to become a magic user. They tend to be very strong in fire and earth type majicks and very strong overall due to their tenacity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dwarf_s_Bane_b_'></a><h1><b>Dwarf's Bane</b></h1>
<br />
When <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> cursed the five races, the Dwarves knew nothing of it. This, however, is an account of what we have learned of it over the last 6,000 years.<br />
<br />
All dwarves are born with wanderlust, the need to roam. Some of this has been tempered out of our race, as the people who can control it or have less of that drive have lived, but it is still there. Even writing about it now, I feel my blood stir.<br />
<br />
After 500 years on this earth, any dwarves who don't live in Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, or on the mountain, near the phoenix, contract a wasting sickness. They slowly get weaker and weaker, wasting away until they die a violent, bed ridden death.<br />
<br />
It was mandated by King Thain<a href="" title="Create page: King+Thain"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, the first, that all dwarves had to come to stay at Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> on their 500th birthday, but many chose to ignore this law, preferring death to separation from their land. Being the stubborn people we are, I would have thought this could have been foreseen.<br />
<br />
If a dwarf away from the mountain survives to 900, it is amazing. Most waste away by the time they reach 700. If one comes to the city later then 600, it is rare that they live any longer then if they had stayed away, as the sickness is too far advanced.<br />
<br />
While the Phoenix moults (every 500-1500 years) there is a chance that some dwarves can die. It is rare, but generally a few dozen don't survive the moult.<br />
<br />
This is all that is known. I will add more when it becomes available.<br />

<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dwarven_Tribes_b_'></a><h1><b>Dwarven Tribes</b></h1>
<br />
<b>The First:</b> This is the group that still inhabit Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Usually very dark skinned, and darker hair. Their ruler is only the second, and rumoured to be over 3000 years old, though no one knows for sure. Many of the inhabitants here are at least 1000 years old. Most were born here and did limited wandering when they were younger. They make all types of magical items, but not the best of any of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Hammerfists:</b> A wandering band of Dwarven mercenaries. They accept any dwarves who will abide by their rules, and many leave before their 500'th birthday. Skilled warriors, and skilled repairmen. They can't make much, but they can repair anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Miner's Guild:</b> The collection of all miners in the dwarven community. They are contracted out to settlement and mining villages across <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>. Most are sent back to Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> before their 500th birthday. A few notable miners, such as Mahktish Boldershoulder, refused to leave their tunnels and wasted away in the line of duty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Oakroots:</b> A group of dwarves that used to be nomads, but have now settled. Mostly based in the town of Lugar<a href="" title="Create page: Lugar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, only a hard days ride west of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They still rely heavily upon their ponies. One of the few dwarven groups that show any affinity for animals. They also make the best magical items of anyone, especially horseshoes that will increase the animals speed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Wanderlusts:</b> The only true nomads left in the Dwarven community. They tend to be fair skinned and haired. They wander from town to town, and are generally considered thieves, no goods, and liars, but being as they are dwarves, all are allowed to stay near towns when around. They also can make weapons that have no rivals.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Merchant's Guild:</b> A loose conglomeration of traders and transporters. They tend to carry contracts with all clans and do all the trading with other races. It is rare for another race to deal with anyone else. Only dwarven friends deal with anyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Bordershields:</b> These dwarves live in towns and villages spread along the dwarven borders. To get past any of them requires a sneak, a bribe, or an army. They excel at making armour, as defence is their main priority. Generally, this is where any famous fighting female dwarves come from.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Leader of each Band (and several members of the Council of the First) carry a ring of Affluence. It shows the Phoenix who they are and gives off a magical aura that makes other dwarves awestruck and other races more easily influenced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='History'></a><h1>History</h1><a id="flipperid539741" class="link" href="javascript:flipWithSign('id539741')">[+]</a><div id="id539741" style="display:none;">
<br />
At the beginning of time, <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a> created seven of us. King Thain and Queen Larzaas were the first to awaken, followed by Gromph, the first Hammerfist, Ragnek, the explorer, Illagurd, the child bearer, Bogard, the weak, and Verna, who never came up in history again. Despite the long life bestowed, we also proved to be quick breeders, populating a city in a mere fifty years. It wasn't until the expansion in 150E that our people even started dying.<br />
The first year, according to the verbal account given by all seven of the First, they simply hid in Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, only venturing out to hunt and gather. All three women had babies in that first year. And in the second. Only Illagurd had more then three in her life, recording a total of fifteen children. Which is why today, when men talk about marrying, they always hope to find &quot;another Illagurd.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn't until the year 4E that we ever had to fight. Bows and spears and hunting tools were common by now, but never for fighting or killing anything other then food. That all changed when the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> tried to enter <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>. All seven of the first, even Illagurd who was in the middle of her term, set out with the Phoenix to stop the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> from finding refuge in <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>. It was a short battle, with King Thain and Gromph proving their martial powers, but the Phoenix was what made the difference. It was also at this time that the Dwarven love for Axes as weapons came about, as both Thain and Gromph found the usefulness for the woodcutting tool.<br />
<br />
Very little happened in the next fifty years. The population continued to grow, and we came out of hiding. We moved from caves into stout stone buildings. Construction on a castle even began, though for what reason, none really knew. It was rumoured that King Thain could see into the future and knew it must be completed if the dwarves were to last. As the castle was completed, and the city looking more then just a village, they were greeted by a visitor none expected.<br />
<br />
A dwarf with skin as dark as obsidian, with fire red hair came among them. None recognised him until he stood before Thain, who at once recognised his creator. Bowing as fast as he could, the rest of his people followed, all realising that this dwarf could be none other then <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a>. A feat lasted for a week before <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a> gave a farewell speech and again left. Few have ever seen him since.<br />
<br />
Another hundred years of growth lead to the mountain being covered. Ragnek, with the King's permission, led a large contingent of dwarves away from the mountain. They settled in the valleys, and the next mountain, and continued to expand, creating another large city at the head of the river that runs south through <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>. Ragnek, Gromph, and a young cartographer headed all the way to the wastelands, mapping the mountains before returning to the new city of Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and then back to Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Another hundred years saw Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> able to support an army that could keep the area clear of bandits and opposing armies. Gromph leads them, becoming the first Hammerfist, and his leadership of them still keeps to this day, many of the traditions handed down, making the Hammerfist nearly unchanged these thousands of years later.<br />
Time went along with little to note, until the year 500E. Both the Wizard's Circle and the <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> visited Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which was, by this time, a sprawling Metropolis. Both were given warm receptions, the Wizard's learning how to bend the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> to do what we do innately by <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a>. The <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> found peace and rest, as the Hammerfists kept the lands highly secure. Much good will was acquired and even to this day <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> are the few <a title="Humans" href='Humans.html' class='wiki'>Humans</a> who are welcome in dwarven lands, though they are treated with much more suspicion then they used to be.<br />
<br />
In the early part of 560E, Gromph escorted Queen Larzaas to the meeting of the Five Races, and joined the Great Alliance. Gromph soon led the Hammerfists around the world, fighting enemies wherever they could be found. One of the more famous was a battle in <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a>, on the Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Gromph led the Hammerfists on an Eight day march, only stopping ot rest three hours every two days. They entered the fray against an army of Vampyres at noon on the eighth day. Gromph led the charge, cutting down two Aluka<a href="" title="Create page: Aluka"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> before the rest of the Hammerfists surged past, pushing the Vampyres<a href="" title="Create page: Vampyres"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> away from the shadow of the wall, and out into a field where they were decimated.<br />
<br />
It was also at the Battle of Terra<a href="" title="Create page: Battle+of+Terra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, as it became known, that the first fire imbued weapons were used, proving to be highly effective against the <a title="Undead" href='Undead.html' class='wiki'>Undead</a> creatures of <a title="darkness" href='darkness.html' class='wiki'>darkness</a>. Many were produced deep in the bowels of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> in the following years, many of which were lost in other battles, but there are still over a dozen in circulation, including the King's Axe.<br />
<br />
Also at this time, the Phoenix went through it's first moult. It was a sight to behold, as it rose out of the bowels of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> in a ball of flame, streaking across the sky, causing a crater that became a cup for it's ashes. King Thain sent out a search party, who mourned over the ashes for three days. On the third day, a new phoenix arose and flew back to it's home under the mountain. Unfortunatly, many of the older dwarves, though none of the First, started to show signs of weakness and ageing. Most of the affected were in Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and King Thain ordered his top researchers to find a cure.<br />
<br />
However, the answer came by way of a young dwarf by the name of Harock, later known as Harock the Delver, who climbed deeper into the volcano of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> then any other. He was convinced that if he could reach the center of All Worlds, he could speak to <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a> directly and know for certain what the ailment was. He turned out to be correct and upon his return, he relayed all of the information to King Thain. This journey took over a year, and Harock's return and news was celebrated by a day of mourning, followed by a week of feasting.<br />
<br />
The Great Alliance had many advantages. One of them being Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which was started in 570E, in conglomeration with the <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a>. While any dwarf will tell you that we built Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, it is undeniable that the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> aided us greatly. Anyone who truly looks into the creation of Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> will see that <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>'s children made the walls what they are.<br />
It took 30 years for the fortress to be completed, but it still stands today, some 5400 years later, just as strong and just as feared as ever. A week long celebration started the march of the Bordershields, a new group of soldiers. Most of them came from Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the other outlying villages. They occupied Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and continued to recruit and send out defensive units all across the dwarven lands. many fell in love with the country and retired there after there service,, which is why most Dwarves you find outside of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are Bordershields to this day.<br />
<br />
Within a month of completing Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, the trolls fell on it with a vengeance. They were rapidly dispersed by the defensive stand made there, where the Bordershields fought at 5 to 1 odds. Redok, who was soon promoted to be leader of Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, sallied forth at the end of the day with a mere two hundred dwarves and did battle at Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>'s gates. There he slew Vegum the Terrible, a giant troll who stood over twelve feet tall, and carried a small battering ram as a club. With their champion dead, the Trolls scattered. The Bordershields hunted them down in ragtag groups for the next month..<br />
<br />
In the year 700E, the first dwarf fell to the Dwarf Bane. A shop keeper in Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, one of Illgurd's children, died at the age of 678, wasted away till he was doubled over and unable to even wield an axe. It was a terrible death, and in his final throws, it is said he wept with the pain the racked his decrepit body. The others who already had the signs of the Bane grew fearful, causing a great downturn in the economy in Lutgar<a href="" title="Create page: Lutgar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Gromph was the first to change things around. He had travelled enough that it was obvious that the Dwarf Bane had set in. His exact words were, &quot;This is just another enemy, like anything else the darkness has thrown at us. I intend to meet it the same way I have any other enemy. Without fear or remorse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words whip-lashed the whole dwarven kingdom and the fear of the Bane no longer ran them. In fact, to this day, many consider it an honour to live long enough to die by the Bane. Especially soldiers.<br />
<br />
It was another hundred years until Gromph died, the first to die of the First. He fell to the Dwarf Bane, wasting away, but still leading the dwarves around the globe hunting <a title="darkness" href='darkness.html' class='wiki'>darkness</a>. It was also in that year, 800E, that the Great Alliance disolved. Many things led to it, Gromph's death high on that list for the dwarves. The Hammerfists and Bordershields started to compete for things to fight it dwarven lands, making them more secure then ever.<br />
<br />
Ferick Goldtooth, a silver tongued dwarf, with leave of King Thain, leads many merchants abroad to trade dwarven goods. They act as a buffer with the rest of the world, making the dwarves appear even more Xenophobic. This isn't true, but it's all in the appearance. The Merchant's Guild, paying their yearly dues, fill the Royal coffers fuller then they have ever been, making the dwarven nation prosper even more.<br />
<br />
In 1221E, the Phoenix goes through it's second moult. A full 10% of the dwarven population falls to the Dwarf's Bane, including Illagurd and Bogard. Ragnek was showing heavy signs of it, but managed to live through the four days of moulting. The population is truly rocked by the death, and the graves are built for a full month before all the dead are buried. It is said that all the cries of the dying echoed through the city for all four days, bringing the King to tears.<br />
Another 300 years found the Trolls from the wasteland besieging Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The Bordershields hold on through over whelming odds. The Hammerfists run resupply raids at random, cracking the trolls long enough to get the Bordershields more supplies and men. This continues on for 100 years, the Hammerfists taking much of the brunt, and the bitter feelings toward the bordershields exist to this day. In 1600E though, the combined weight of both forces, swelled to an unprecedented size, expel the Trolls, chasing them deep into the wastelands. The Hammerfists are nearly decimated in this attack, but they have done their jobs. When greeted by Theron Sheildarm, head of the Bordershields, Gwerm the Hammerfist, (as all leaders of the Hammerfists were known) spit on him and called him a coward. For the leaders of these two group to meet today requires the King residing to be present for their to be any sort of civility.<br />
<br />
It took another 100 years of combined effort to fully defeat the trolls, but it was done. After the Battle in the Waste, the trolls were beaten so soundly, some claimed that their were none left alive in Eramor. This was not true, but few were seen for the next thousand years and the dwarven kingdom resumed it's prosperous and expanding reign. The Hammerfists regained their members and started to trek outside of the dwarven borders again.<br />
<br />
During this time, the Phoenix moults a third time. All of the First, except the King and Queen, have fallen in this four days. The King kissed each of them good bye on their deathbed before retreating to the castle. His cries echoed over the city as 25% of the population died. Most of those were from people who lived outside of Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, but such a blow still took time to recover from.<br />
<br />
In 2145E, Harok the Delver, nearly doubled over with the Dwarf Bane, lead a group of miners to the court, and received a commission, much as the Merchant's Guild had, and left to mine the richest places in the world. Harok only made it a day off the mountain before he died, a pick still in his hands. Many of the Miner's Guild hold true to that example, mining well past the times they should.<br />
<br />
In 2589E, King Thain, fearing the Phoenix's next moult, issues the 500 Year mandate. It says that all dwarves shall return to Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> before their 500th year, as his advisor's and researchers have determined that is when the Dwarf Bane sets in. Nearly every dwarf scoffs at it, and it is largely ignored initially. Although today, it is followed by more then 50% of the population.<br />
<br />
It was over 100 years before the Trolls finally reared their ugly, wasteland heads again. However, they never committed themselves in force as they did during the Siege of Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Even to the present day, the Bordershields continue their skirmishing battle with the trolls, keeping them a more then healthy distance from the Fire Gate<a href="" title="Create page: Fire+Gate"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
Little happened over the next 200 years until King Thain, the Second, was born. His parents were both well boyond an age any thought that child bearing could ever occur. The city celebrated for a month, and both the Bordershields and Hammerfists set a representative with gifts to train the young dwarf. Though, being as he was an only child and heir to the throne, King Thain, the Second, never saw battle. More then a little bitter about it, he married young, at the age of 50, and his wife bore him many children before he joined his father to visit the other world leaders in 3335E.<br />
Unfortunately for all of the dwarves everywhere, King Thain, the First, didn't make it more then a day away from Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, as stepping away from the mountain allowed the Dwarf's Bane to set in, making up for all the time he had lived on this earth. His body was sent back, aged beyond recognition. Queen Larzaas, in her grief, drew her dagger and slew herself over his body. She was the last of the First to die. Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> was left to mourn for a year before returning to normal. King Thain, the Second, continued the journey before returning to mourn his father.<br />
In 3587E, a short period of time for us dwarves, the Phoenix moulted again. The death toll soared, reaching into the tens of thousands. Not city or group was safe this time, and the death toll staggered those that lived. Even the Phoenix was shocked upon it's rebirth. Conveniently, a baby boom happened over the next 10 years, giving many back twice what they had lost.<br />
<br />
Everything remained normal, with the minor wars and skirmishes until the Phoenix moulted again in 4999E. There was very little death this time, comparatively, though the death toll rose into the 10,000 range. It was a relief to many dwarves as not all moulting's meant an end to the populace. A baby boom happened again after the moulting, leading many to believe that the Phoenix was related to fertility as well.<br />
<br />
The sixth moulting in 5567E, that coincided with the birth of King Thain, the Third, strengthened that idea. Unfortunately King Thain, the Second, took ill during that moulting, but he seemed to will himself through, getting better within the week of the Phoenix's return. Many called him Strongwill after this, impressed by his resurgence.<br />
