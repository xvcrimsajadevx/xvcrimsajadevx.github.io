<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Halflings<br />
<br />
<b>Type:</b> Mammal (Human sub-race)<br />
<br />
<b>Life Span:</b> Average is about 100 years, oldest age recorded is 126<br />
<br />
<b>Region:</b> Halflings can pretty much be found everywhere humans can be found, though they tend to prefer the countryside instead of crowded areas. The majority of Halflings are found in Avalon, with the exception of Teran A’ao.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
The average Halfling ranges from 3’ to 4’ tall with the tallest recorded Halfling, after the evolution, being 4’4”. The average life span of a Halfling is longer than a human because over their period of evolution they rarely had conflict or contact which resulted in a strong immune system. Physically, a Halfling is obvious weaker than their much larger counterparts, though they are skilled in stealth and are more agile.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Personality_traits_b_'></a><h1><b>Personality traits</b></h1>
<br />
Behaviour: Like humans, the behavior of Halflings varies depending on individual personality and their environment. As a society, Halflings are known to be rather reserved and weary of other races preferring to keep to themselves. Generally, Halflings loves information and can be rather sneaky when needed. Though like all humans there are variations of behavior depending on circumstances and experiences.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Halflings are believed to have originated back to around the time when human kingdoms were first being created. Due to variation in humans every once and a while, a deformed human would be born, and in this case a short human would be born. These shorter humans were feared as being punishment and were exiled from normal human society. These exiled humans, over the years, would find each other and start their own communities. Eventually, over many years those different humans evolved into their own sub-race of Halflings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
Because Halflings originated from humans, they also have the potential with Ether majick, though it is rarer than a human being about 1/200 having Ether ability and talents are almost unheard of among Halflings. It is rare for a Halfling to be sent to the Wizarding Isles, but not unheard of. Most Halflings that embrace their Ether abilities are taught majick privately as an apprentice to a wizard or sorcerer.<br />
<br />
They have their own Trickster class which utilises their innate abilities to cast simple and intricate illusions (strength of illusion depends upon the individual).<br />

<br />
<b>Habitat:</b> Halflings are pretty adaptable and they can live in many different climates, though they are very rarely seen in the desert. Preferably, the majority of Halflings live in lightly hilled areas with comfortable furnished homes in small communities away from larger cities. Of course, because of variety in personality like humans, Halflings can be found pretty much anywhere and are assimilated into normal human society.<br />
<br />
Outside of Laquinya, just before you reach the rolling hills to the north there is believed to be a large settlement of Halflings. These peaceful and fun loving beings have taken for themselves a small portion of the rolling landscape to make there own. Their homes are built close to the ground with earthen walls and grassy roof that blend seamlessly with their surroundings. Every building is built to the needed proportions for their diminutive size compared to their human cousins with door only 5 to 5 ½ feet in height and windows much lower to the ground. To help insure their seclusion the home are sunken into the earth so that only a portion of them appear above and would easily be overlooked by a passerby.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Breeding:</b> Like humans, Halflings have live births through sexual reproduction.<br />
<br />
Diet: Halflings are omnivores so they must eat a balanced diet of meat and vegetation, though usually with a preference to the latter. Halflings do not require as much food as a normal sized human due to their size, but many Halflings love the luxury of eating more meals than the average human.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Like other humans, Halflings are mainly predators as they hunt for their own food and can be accomplished killers. Also, they are prey to humans and Darkness just like everything else.<br />
<br />
<b>Deadly or Safe:</b> Either, depends on individual personality<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Agriculture and Commerce:</b><br />
Agriculture is performed only in designated areas where their plantings would be hidden from the casual observer and jealously guarded.<br />
As the Halflings are for the most part self sufficient, commerce is seldom performed, especially with humans especially in their settlements. Though there is not much they would have to barter with other races for or with they do produce some of the finest pipe tobacco and loomed fabrics in the realm. They also grow a rare delicacy often referred to as the Halfling top hat or simply top hats. These mushroom that appear similar to a Morrell are prized by many a chef and tightly controlled by the community.<br />
<br />
<b>Relations with Other Races:</b><br />
In general Halflings are suspicious of outsiders. Though the occasional elf might be allowed entrance into their community it is a rare thing indeed for a human, especially an adult, to be found anywhere near their tightly knit communities. Dwarfs are not as feared as their human cousins yet they too are rarely seen in socializing with them.<br />
<br />
<b>Military and Weaponry:</b><br />
Halflings have a very small military presence. Due to their peaceful natures and lifestyles they do not have large encampments of armed men but only small, home based militias. Often only a few men are ever on duty at a time. There fighting style relies more on stealth and surprise than on brute strength or a show of force. Often they will remain hidden among the high grasses unseen by others observing and waiting to sound the alarm if danger approaches. Their small size and agility are two of their greatest assets and are used to great advantage. Little armor is typically worn. Padded or leather armor may occasionally be seen but for the most part they have abandoned such protection in favor of freedom of the freedom of movement not wearing them provides. Weapons are typically farm implement base such as pitchforks with sharpened tips and improvised hoes. Daggers and short swords are used by the more experienced or higher ranking militia men but are rarely employed by the common soldier.<br />
<br />
<b>Occupations:</b><br />
Outside of their communities Halflings are prized for their abilities. You can find them employed as spies because of the great ability to gather information. As quite rural communities gossip and information from the outside world is highly prized. Many gain these skills within their communities and than may leave hoping to profit from their skills. Halflings can also be found as members of thieves guilds as there stealthy nature and agile bodies perform well for such careers.<br />
