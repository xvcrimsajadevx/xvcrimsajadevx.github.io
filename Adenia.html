<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Adenia<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> South coasts of Avalon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns, cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Capital_Aielin_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital - Aielin</b></h2>
<br />
Situated in a delta, and surrounded by the Four Rivers, Aielin is the jewel in Adenia's crwn. A massive harbour city, with docks surrounding all sides of the city, boats lad and unload day and night, and trade is always good. The city has no walls, it does not need a perimeter wall. It has natural defences against invaders - the rivers and the bridges and the delta itself. The city buildings are designed and made by both man and elf, the palace designed by the elves, as well as all of the white bridges. The design of the city is very similar to Azaili cities, the pillars and fluting towers very sleek, very white and very smooth. The cobbled streets are kept clean, and even the cities pleasure district is by day very respectable. The geography of Aielin is quite simple, all main roads lead to the docks, and to the palace, and the palace is at the centre of the city. The city spread out from it, in winding streets, some wide, some narrower alleys. The buildings tend to be around three stories high, and vary from shops to residents to warehouses. There are four bridges that lead out of the cities and onto the plains, which are fertile and used as farmland. Much of the cities food comes in from the countryside, but also through the docks from all over the world and the country.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Tayrel_b_'></a><h2><b>Tayrel</b></h2>
<br />
Located in the north of the souther region, near the border with Eraosia, Tayrel is surrounded by a huge, dense forest. It is a fortified city, because it is so close to Eraosia, but it does not have the atmosphere of such a place. Its streets are wide and clean, the trees have grow so tall so they almost completely obscure the city. Many high nobles have manors here, in and around the city. Some estates are located outside of the Forest of Tarl, but have good roads going into the city itself.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Oreani_b_'></a><h2><b>Oreani</b></h2>
<br />
Built into the mountains, this city is the heart of Adenia's Military. This is where Adenia's generals meet and form strategies, and where most of the army are now posted. The mistrust between Adenia and Teran is reflected in the numbers f soldiers in this city and the surrounding villages. Carved out of the mountains, with waterfalls and rivers cascading from the heights of the city, Oreani is fortified but also beautiful. Steep and winding streets lead up t the four main towers. Few nobles decide to settle here as it is often a target of foreign hate and insurgents. The southern slopes of the city is in ruins from a battle fifty years ago with a group of Decimators from Eraosia.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Poequi_b_'></a><h2><b>Poequi</b></h2>
<br />
Not a harbour, but it does have docks. Its main use is again for the military, and so few common people live or work here. Arms manufacture and dwarven smiths live here and a lot of movement occurs through this city. Armies gather and are distributed t the forts along Adenia's northern border. Built on the flat lands, with forests to the north, and the ocean to the south, Poequi is important t Adenia's army, and is therefore well fortified and quiet isolated. Much of their supplies come in from other area's via the fortified docks. In a time of war, many gather here.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Renesu_b_'></a><h2><b>Renesu</b></h2>
<br />
Renesu is a city that has rivers flowing through it also, and thus many bridges. The landmarks of Adenia are definitely its many bridges. Many of them are either built by the elves or copies of the elven architecture. This city does some trade with Eraosia, and has a history of insurgents attacking it in times of war. It has never been invaded though, and is currently thriving because of the trade that passes along its rivers.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laquinya_b_'></a><h2><b>Laquinya</b></h2>
<br />
A town on the southernmost coast of Adenia. This is a idylic place, and has little trade. It is mainly a picturesque town that the common people live in. Because of its tranquil nature very few nobles live here. Those that do tend to have estates near the town, and get their supplies from it. Very much a sleepy town situated in a wide valley that goes all the way to the sea. Hills to the north and flat lands and beaches to the south. A beautiful area f the country and devoid of trading ports, only small vessels can dock here.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Hyulun_b_'></a><h2><b>Hyulun</b></h2>
<br />
A town in the dryer lands inland. A debouched place, with an interesting reputation. Adenia's lose morals and odd customs and beliefs are explored here. Very quiet during the day, a seemingly sleepy little town in the middle of nowhere with barely any roads going near it, at night it comes alive and fireworks and music can be seen and heard for miles around. Few villages settle ear it, as the nightly noises tend to spook the animals.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Caruin_b_'></a><h2><b>Caruin</b></h2>
<br />
A town built upon the north south border, in the middle of the country, and n the coast. A smaller version of Aielin in looks, it has smaller rivers but a similar Elven and <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> architecture. The temples of the gods are found here and many pilgrims come to here preachers, especially the Azaili Priests. The Children of the Waves have their headquarters here as well.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Valoon_b_'></a><h2><b>Valoon</b></h2>
<br />
A port town situated south west of Aielin, and between two of her rivers. The first port of call for all ships coming from the northern hemisphere. A basic port town that has more taverns then shops. Many warehouses are spread around the docks as well, which wealthy merchants rent for high prices.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Shedu_b_'></a><h2><b>Shedu</b></h2>
<br />
A port town that lies between the other two rivers of Aielin. The first port of call for all ships coming from the southern hemisphere - many elven vessels and merchants settle here and stop here before they continue on to Aielin. A basic port town that has more taverns then shops. Many warehouses are spread around the docks as well, which wealthy merchants rent for high prices. It is a town twinned with Valoon and is identical in structure and look.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
A mish mash of cultures from all over the world have created a country that is very balanced and free. Its people are kind, eccentric and hard working, and the land itself is fertile and rich. The north and the south have variations in their culture, but they all serve their royal house, and the local nobles keep the peace and the laws in the name of the Monarch, who is currently Laila Tremingale.<br />
<br />
Adenia has a rich heritage and has never been invaded by any other country on Avalon. They have long been at war with Eraosia but in recent times there has been a period of silence. Not peace, but no activity and no attempts from Eraosia to launch an attack and engage Adenia. They have tried to infiltrate Adenia, but with little success. Adenia's relationships with its other neighbours varies. Fenlar is an ally, but Teran A'ao has a history of bad blood and betrayal. Adenians are slow to trust Teran's, and keep their distance from that border.<br />
<br />
Adenia is a country of agriculture and great cities, with peaceful wild lands and clans and tribes able to roam free. It has a steady, mild to hot climate, and a good rainfall which keeps the crops all over the country well watered.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_People_of_Adenia_b_'></a><h1><b>The People of Adenia:</b></h1>
<br />
Adenians are generally very friendly, and quite weird. Slightly slanted eyes, and tanned skins, Adenians are a fair/beautiful people, slim and small, the female nobles are like porcelain dolls (nobles tend to whiten their skin as they see the tan as something the commoners have because they work outside and in the sun). The men dress in ghastly colours, very bright and jarring on the eye, whereas all the women where mixes of blues, silvers and greys. Beautiful low cut dresses, perfect for the Adenian weather which in summer is hot and breezy and in winter, the occasional rainstorm and frost. The poorer Adenian's are not destitute. They tend to work on the docks, and in the taverns, or as farm hands. A pleasant people as a whole, even the nobles are somewhat tolerable.<br />
<br />
Some of Adenia's stranger customs are cutting off the ear of an eavesdropper, holding a new born by its ankles over a river for good luck and a good life, kissing a donkey on the Day of the Cow, and running around a great oak twenty times when you have been hexed by a witch doctor.<br />
<br />
All pretty harmless, but taken very seriously by Adenians.<br />
<br />
They are a mix of everything, influenced by many cultures and races.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
Adenia has a child queen. Laila was crowned when she was 13 years old, after her father, mother and brothers were assassinated. To hold the country together she was raised as Queen. She was the heir to the throne and had been taught the ways of the Imperial Court, but no one ever expected that she would be reigning when she was still a child. She is protected by not only the higher houses of Adenia, but by the wizards too. An unstable Adenia would be a disaster for many. She has a wizard advisor who protects her politically and physically.<br />
<br />
House Tremingale has one pure blooded member left, and her wizard, Atreya Vinesteen, will do anything to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
Its religion mimics that if the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>, and its culture mirrors it. All Adenia's who are nt minions, worship the Light. They have a strange way of ding it though. The amalgamation of Azaili culture and beliefs and the human cultures and belief systems have created a microcosm of strange religions. They all believe roughly the same things, with variations according to region. The north is far more practical and their roots in the Light and its temples are filled with priests and worshippers. In the south the Azaili influence is strong and the people are taught in the Azaili temples that are dedicated to the origin Azure.<br />
<br />
A cult called the Children of the Waves train magic users in Hydromancy and seek to become <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>. The Azaili priests encourage this and often aid the members in learning their water majicks.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
Adenia has strange laws. Strange customs make it hard to know what is breaking the law and what is not.<br />
Cutting off the ear of an eavesdropper<br />
Shaving the head of a liar<br />
Strapping a naked thief to the town pillar for two days.<br />
Drowning Murderers<br />
Hanging Traitors<br />
Trade and Currency:<br />
<br />
Trade is rich. Adenia has the best ports in Avalon, and the best trade in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
It's main exports are;<br />
Gold<br />
Textiles<br />
Food Stuffs<br />
Azaili Merchandise<br />
Wine<br />
Extra Info:<br />
<br />
There is a cult called The Children of the Waves that recruit magic users. Its not Adenia's official religion, but it is seen as a worthy religion to follow.<br />
