<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
The Ether is a force that exists in all worlds, but only in the Nether Realm can humans use it to weave majicks. Humans, the Obsidian Elves, Djinn, Eria and their creations can use this primal power. The Ether keeps the Nether Realm neutral; that is its only purpose.<br />
<br />
Humes are trained in various ways in  how to use the ether and each style believes it is the perfect way to use this primal power. From sorcerers, wizards, shaman and <a title="mages" href='mages.html' class='wiki'>mages</a> to Djinn worshippers, water mages, and all kinds.<br />
<br />
This article explains how these humes (and few other creatures) use the Ether as well as giving examples of the kind of spells that can be cast. The wizarding and sorcery spells are particular to those crafts but other majick users may have their own (albeit less powerful) versions of them.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majicks_b_'></a><h1><b>Majicks</b></h1>
<br />
All ether users use the Ether in a similar way, so as an example we will use wizards and sorcerers for now.<br />
<br />
<a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> and <a title="Sorcerers" href='Sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>Sorcerers</a> manipulate the Ether by touching the primal force via incantations, the mind or hand gestures to cast <a title="majick" href='majick.html' class='wiki'>majick</a> of varying forms. Each individual wizard/sorcerer uses either their mind, a hand gesture or an incantation to shape the Ether; this is known as spell casting. These techniques vary depending on the spell, the school and the spell caster.<br />
<br />
Over time, certain wizards/sorcerers construct their own <a title="grimoires" href='grimoires.html' class='wiki'>grimoires</a> (spell books). The more innovative the wizard/sorcerer the more spells he/she will record within his/her book. They are often the pride of the individual and usually can only be cast by the creator of the spell. Some of these grimoires have been recovered over time, however none of them can be understood at all; it is believed that each individual who comprised a grimoire also cast a confounding or protection spell upon them.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: Spells of Wizardry and Sorcery schools are not universal and players can invent their own for all crafts. the ones listed all over the wiki majick pages are to be used as guidelines to give examples of the types of spells schools use and the types of spells most ether users might use.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_White_Majick_b_'></a><h2><b>White Majick</b></h2>
<br />
White majicks are spells cast only by wizards. They are called so because they use the Ether in an altruistic and benevolent fashion and do not use magic for evil purposes. This is a reflection of a Wizard's choice to live in the Light and protect the innocent. White majick is not supposed to be forceful; the Ether is supposed to flow around a wizard and manipulate the world with its spells, not be used to subjugate.<br />
<br />
Specific spells are listed in the <a title="Seven Schools of Wizardry" href='Seven+Schools+of+Wizardry.html' class='wiki'>Seven Schools of Wizardry</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Black_Majick_b_'></a><h2><b>Black Majick</b></h2>
<br />
Black majicks are spells cast only by <a title="sorcerers" href='sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>sorcerers</a>. They are called so because they use the Ether in twisted and malevolent fashion and always use magic for evil purposes. This is a reflection of a Sorcerer's choice to live in <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and act as Minions<a href="" title="Create page: Minions"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Black majick is inherently forceful; the Ether ravages    and bends the world to the will of the sorcerer using these spells. They subjugate, torture and infuse fear and suffering through the use of their black majicks.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Summoners_amp_Quasi_b_'></a><h1><b>Summoners &amp; Quasi</b></h1>
<br />
There are two types of summoner:<br />
<br />
First there were the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> who summon the Gods, the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>. This race are powerful and rare and can only be applied for once permission has been granted by our admins. For information on how Quasi summon, go to the <a title="Art of Summoning" href='Art+of+Summoning.html' class='wiki'>Art of Summoning</a>.<br />
<br />
The second kind of summoner is a weaker sub race of hume. They can only summon creatures from the Shadow Realm, not the Eria who dwell there. Anyone can apply for this type of summoner. For more details about this kind of summoning go to <a title="Summoners" href='Summoners.html' class='wiki'>Summoners</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Elements_amp_Magi_b_'></a><h1><b>The Elements &amp; Magi</b></h1>
<br />
Any ether user can turn Magi. Again for the sake of an example wizards and sorcerers will be used as the default casters to explain this phenomenon. See <a title="The Children of the Waves" href='The+Children+of+the+Waves.html' class='wiki'>The Children of the Waves</a> for another example of how turning Magi can become a religion or sorts.<br />
<br />
Through the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> all wizards and sorcerers can manipulate the elements. This by passes the Origins and are very unstable spells. Wizards and sorcerers who are consumed (the ether is supposed to flow around the user not be taken into the user - this is dangerous and unstable) by these majicks become Magi - pure elements in human form. Part of the ether, they are the human embodiment of that element.<br />
<br />
To turn into a <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a> a wizard/sorcerer must be adept in using elemental majicks. These are spells separate from the school they are trained in (necromancy/bewitchment/etc) and natural talents all Wizards/sorcerers are able to have/develop. How they use the elements is the same way they use the ether, they manipulate them. A race of the Origins would connect to the Origin, a dragon for instance, would channel Tempests divinity/air element through them to control the weather, for example. They draw the element into themselves, and from the source, Tempest to control it.<br />
<br />
Whereas a wizard using aeromancy would push and pull at the element, the world/air around them and force them to conform to his/her will. They manipulate the element, rather then channel it.<br />
<br />
When a wizard becomes a magi the wall between them and the element is breached, the element enters them and manipulates/changes them... makes them a part of the element itself. The only reason they are not destroyed is because of their connection to the Ether. They are as the origins are but instead of being the source of the element they are absorbed into it and flow as a part of it, they are made of it and it of them, transformed, every molecule of their human body morphed into fire or earth, air or water...<br />
<br />
A wizard/sorcerer may have been trying to control the weather, and lost control, got hit by lightening. The loss of control along with prolonged exposure to the elemental magic causes the change. Anyone not concentrating, not trained enough in using the ether, or at breaking point emotionally (i.e too angry, grieving, scared.) can cause this rupture and set of the chain reaction that turns them into a Magi.<br />
<br />
A wizard/sorcerer could be highly emotional at the time and fighting for their life... most Magi's were wizards or sorcerers who ended up using elemental magic as their main spells...most discard their schools and fight, study and play with the elements, they are obsessed with them and become addicted. As their addiction consumes them, in the end so does the element they have an affinity and skill with.<br />
<br />
The elemental spells wizards and sorcerers use:<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <b>PYROMANCY</b>
</li><li> <b>GEOMANCY</b>
</li><li> <b>AEROMANCY</b>
</li><li> <b>HYDROMANCY</b>
</li></ul>
<br />
Types of Magi are:<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <b>PYRO-MAGI</b>
</li><li> <b>GEO-MAGI</b>
</li><li> <b>AERO-MAGI</b>
</li><li> <b>HYDRO-MAGI</b>
</li></ul>
<br />
Being consumed by the element changes their nature, their very form becomes as the element. Once they become Magi they are no longer wizards or sorcerers, or indeed, human.<br />
<br />
NOTE- NOT ALL MAGI WERE FORMALLY WIZARDS OR SORCERERS. SOME HUMANS THAT ARE UNTRAINED MAY TAP ENOUGH OF AN ELEMENT AND BE CONSUMED. THIS IS RARE AS UNTRAINED MAGIC USER'S WOULD PROBABLY DIE INSTEAD OF TURN MAGI AS THERE HANDLE ON MAGIC WOULD BE SO POOR. ITS THE TRAINING THAT PRESERVES THE SOUL.<br />
<br />
THERE ARE SOME TRAINED NON WIZARDS WHO BECOME MAGI, THESE ARE NORMALLY BY CHOICE AND WITH THE GUIDANCE OF POWERFUL BEINGS SUCH AS THE DJINN. THE DRUIDS OF OMRI AND THE CHILDREN OF THE WAVES ARE TWO SUCH GROUPS THAT HAVE A GOAL TO BECOME MAGI AND DO IT SUCCESSFULLY. IT IS THEIR RELIGION AND MAGI IS THEIR ASCENSION TO A HIGHER PLAIN.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Three_Forms_of_Spellcasting_b_'></a><h1><b>Three Forms of Spellcasting</b></h1>
<br />
Wizards and sorcerers channel the Ether in three ways;<br />
<br />
<div class="simplebox"><b>Mind, Incantation, Hand Gestures</b></div><br />
<br />
Not every wizard can use all three, but every wizard uses at least one. Some prefer one technique over another, but all have their drawbacks and positives. Many ether users will use these casting techniques and some may develop their own unique ways.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Mind_b_'></a><h2><b>Mind</b></h2>
<br />
Use of the ether with the mind is a hard technique to perfect. Only the strongest wizards/sorcerers are able to do it and only certain spells can be performed using this technique, not every spell can be cast using the mind and some spells can be cast no other way. Mind magic can be volatile and hard to control. Loss of concentration can make the spell fail, sometimes at a crucial moment. Very few can perform mind magic with distractions. Sometimes this can result in madness, and a spell destroy the mind because of a lax in concentration.<br />
<br />
Telekinesis, teleportation and telepathy are typical mind majicks. They can be performed with a hand gesture or incantation but work at their best when cast with the mind. Wizards who have mastered these spells with their minds are rare and the most powerful of wizards/sorcerers.<br />
<br />
There is a strange tendency for mind wizards to go over to the Darkness once they have mastered this craft. Some speculate that the opening of the mind to the Ether somehow makes the mind vulnerable to the Darkness. The wizards who do stay White tend to be adept in warding spells and protecting their minds, magical barriers constantly surround them.<br />
<br />
An example of a mind spell would be lighting a fire. The wizard would simply focus his or her mind and think the fire into being (and depending on the school the fire would be conjured, invoked, enchanted etc).<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Incantation_b_'></a><h2><b>Incantation</b></h2>
<br />
This is the most common technique and most spells can be cast using it. Wizards and sorcerers who use incantation tend to have their own versions of the basic spells, correlating a list in their own black or white grimoire<a href="" title="Create page: grimoire"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> (spell book). The spell is simply said aloud clearly and concisely. Normally it is a simple rhyme or a coded phrase the wizard or sorcerer has invented, but more often then not it is simply one word.<br />
<br />
An example of an incantation spell would be lighting the fire again. The wizard would simply chant the words of the memorized spell from his grimoire (or from his training, a grimoire is does not always need to be read from, that depends on the spell and the caster) and the fire would spark alight.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Hand_Gestures_b_'></a><h2><b>Hand Gestures</b></h2>
<br />
The easiest of all the techniques and the way apprentices first learn to channel the Ether properly. Before they are trained they may accidentally use mind majick or even read a spell from a grimoire. But hand gestures are controlled and precise. They are almost as commonly used as incantations and have fewer limitations then the spoken spells. But the one major drawback is that new spells cannot be invented using just hand gestures. An incantation is needed first or a word of command.<br />
<br />
An example of a hand gestured spell would be once again, lighting the fire. The wizard would simply wave his hand in the correct manner, fingers and the flick of the wrist just so, and the fire would begin burning...<br />
