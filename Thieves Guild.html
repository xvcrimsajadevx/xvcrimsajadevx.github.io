<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Headquarters are in Pan, a city in the north of Eraosia. They have guild houses all over Avalon though.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> The Human thieves have a normal human lifespan, but the Shifters, who are in the higher positions of leadership have been around for centuries. This is one of the reasons this guild is as organised as it is.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b> They make a point of appearing as inconspicuous as possible.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b> All members of the guild are sneaky, ambitious and have no qualms about taking from the rich or the poor.<br />
<br />
<b>History:</b> It is only known that it was the shifters who organised thievery. Nothing else leaves the guild halls walls, and no-one but the members know the intricacies of the organisation. As is the nature of Shifters, no one knows the name or face of its leaders. The wealth of this guild is understandable. Smaller guilds have tried stealing from them, but are always unsuccessful.<br />
<br />
<b>Magic:</b> Shifters have natural abilities that they do not consider magic. They can morph and mimic almost anything, making them the best thieves in Avalon.<br />
