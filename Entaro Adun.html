General Appearance:<br />
<br />
Entaro is the last remaining member of his dark &amp; corrupted lineage on the forgotten Isles. He is the first in his family to ever be born with silver colored hair as all those before him in past generations had jet black to match their dark hearts. For this he was branded as an unwanted outcast among his brethren as he was seen as being less than the perfection his parents sought of him.<br />
<br />
Having lead the life of a toiling commoner/slave Enatro has a well toned physique that has caught the eye of many of his kind in envy. To match the darkness of his heart as well as his soul entaro will wear nothing but black as he has always felt that it added more depth to his already dark appearance. He wears a jet black cloak wherever he goes whether it be to his next kill or even for the simple task of stealing supplies from one of the local merchants. He keeps his dark silvery colored hair cut shortas he has always seen long hair as a trait only suitable for females. Thus he has always made sure to keep it short as well as spiked to make himself stand out from the rest of his race. His eyes are the blackest of black with a tinge of purple around his irises that has at time actually stunned the wary travelers that he has come across before he brutally killed them.<br />
<br />
While there is little else not already fore mentioned Entaro has also saw fit to have his family crest woven into all of his clothes as well as etched into his weapons. Originally his family crest was a dagger plunging through the heart of Titan, although since becoming the sole survivor of the house of Adun he had it changed to a black dragon enveloped in a silver colored fire.<br />
<br />
<b>PERSONALITY:</b><br />
<br />
As with almost all oh his alamia of elves Entaro is no different as the vile darkness flows through his veins. He cares not for anyone or anything else but himself as he would kill for even the smallest of personal gains. While he was once a creature of the light seeking redemption for his races’ sins now he only seeks greed. Entaro is swift to pas his vile judgment on those around him for if they do even the slightest of mistakes as he will tolerate nothing but the best. He trusts no one but himself as he sees those around him as imperfect rejects not worthy of the dark gifts given to them by the darkness itself. He knows no morals or principles and does anything &amp; everything that he sees fit to satisfy his corrupted heart.<br />
<br />
Even those around him think of him as wildly sadistic being that he enjoys killing his victims as slowly as possible to make them endure his agonizing blood thirst till he felt satisfied. While unconfirmed it has been rumored that he has kept victims alive for nearly a whole week before finally letting them die. He especially craves beings of the light as he feels it his lifelong obligation to the nether realm of all the creations of Titan.<br />
<br />
Entarors’ short temper is what he is feared for most for as even the smallest of things can set him off on a murderous rampage cutting the throats of whoever disturbed him. Even through all the darkness he does retain a small fragment of light. At times he will go into deep meditation to control the evil brewing inside of him so as not to let it cloud his judgment in battle that could ultimately lead to his demise. He never used to do such, but attributes it to the disciplined teachings of his former Nyorynian master that had attempted to cleanse the darkness from him long ago.<br />
<br />

<b>BACKSTORY:</b><br />
<br />
Entaro Adun was born in the onyx city into a wealthy bloodline, but lives the life of a lowly commener. When he was born his parents instantly rejected him for he had silver colored hair. They saw it as a inferior trait as all members from the house of Adun were born with jet black hair. For this sin he was viewed by all his family as nothing more than a meager slave. As the years passed entaros’ utter hatred towards them grew higher and higher, until he finally lost control and sadistically slaughtered them all in one night. Having freed himself from their contempt he was finally able to take his place as the new head of his house once and for all.<br />
<br />
Shortly afterwards entaro had grown to feel empty as if something was missing in his life, and even began to notice a sense of guilt &amp; remorse for the evil acts he had committed. For a short while he even tried to purify himself of the darkness that brewed inside him. It was on one of his journeys to Lenal that he captured an old Nyorynian monk who in their pleads for mercy offered entaro redemption in exchange for sparing their life. He accepted their offer reluctantly as the torment of his guilt was just becoming more than he could bear any longer. As expected he found his teacher’s trainging to be very frustrating as it entailed intense meditation as well as the willpower to stop himself from acting on his wicked instinct. Although after countless years of practice &amp; patience he began to master it as for the first time in his life he felt at peace in the light.<br />
<br />
Entaros’ new found inner peace would not last though as he would eventually witness his master’s death by the hand of another of his kind as it was just their damned natural instinct to kill. It was then that entaro forsake all that he had been taught as he watched as his mentor, who he had even at times felt was like a father to him, died in his arms. Never again would he walk in the light as all that he felt &amp; cared about now was mercilessly bringing pain and suffering to everyone &amp; everything that got in his way.<br />
<br />
Although in more recent events entaro has had to deal with the constant attacks of other rival houses attempting to destroy his in its’ weakened state. Since the demise of his family by his own hands he has become the new head of his house as well as taking his father’s title as a nobleman. Even with his much higher status he was still regarded as pretty much a lowly slave good for nothing more than for breeding purposes. It had been nearly 75 years ago when his house had joined the clan of the Malevolent Bereave as his father sought more power &amp; influence as his house was well known and feared for their ruthlessness. This would in turn cause entaro more trouble as once the other house;s heard of their demise they battled to claim it all for themselves. For entaro had not yet been recognized as it’s new head.<br />
<br />
While he would have to deal with many hard times ahead throughout this period he always fought them all back even going so far as to kill the heads of several of the lesser houses thus bringing them into chaos. Once he was finally set in as the permanent leader of the empty house of Adun entaro sought the audience with the Matriarch of the Malevolent Bereave Vahirga <a title="Men’Zonine" href="Men%E2%80%99Zonine.html" class="wiki">Men’Zonine</a> so that he might possibly find a place in the Ashen Guard thus proving himself as more than a worthless male among their society. Entaro had taken great interest in her more specifically as her sadistic &amp; sinister ways he had grown to greatly admire. He saw her as a true perfect being in all of the nether realm, and someone that truly saw their dark gifts as a blessing taking full advantage of them in their cruel lifestyle.<br />
<br />
Entaro knew that this newfound goal would be by no means easy as it was likely that she would have him beheaded simply for disturbing her, but he would pursue it nonetheless. He was alone in his house with little to no chance of becoming a powerful leader if he did nothing to change his fate in this female dominated society. He didn’t like the thought of ever serving under a female as it had not been his choice to join such an obscure form of leadership. So he would either find prosperity &amp; power through Vahirga, or he would die trying as he had long since grown tired of living the life of a damned slave and would do anything to finally be rid of it forever.<br />
