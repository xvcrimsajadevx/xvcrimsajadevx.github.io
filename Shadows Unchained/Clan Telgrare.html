<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance:</b></h1>
<br />
The clan emblem, publicly, is a red ship on black seas. When they decide to leave evidence that they took action against a target, they leave a dark grey broken chain link. When they are acting against a target, they wear dark grey clothing that conceals their identity. Otherwise, they dress to not stand out.<br />

Silent, swift, loyal beyond death.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History:</b></h1>
<br />
The Shadows Unchained are a group of obsidian elves that have rejected Darkness and follow &quot;The Storm Lords&quot;. The Storm Lords are darker versions of Azure and Tempest. They are believers in the concept that a balance must be maintained between Light and Darkness, which isn't the case currently. Most of the group are sailors by profession, least that is their cover. They are trained sorcerers with a focus on stealth and dirty tricks.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h1><b>Magic:</b></h1>
<br />
In addition to the normal racial abilities, they are skilled in air and water elemental magics, especially those relating to the sea/storms. They tend to try to balance out their necromantic skill with healing skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
The clan maintains a base of operations on a remote island, away from the Forgotten Isles, as a training center and fortress to fall back to if they are ever compromised. They have enemies on both sides, Light and Dark, as they will target whoever they feel is swaying the balance of things unduly.<br />
