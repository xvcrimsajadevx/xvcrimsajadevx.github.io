<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Isles de Mortis<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> South East, a hundred miles off the coast of Stalicia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_Islands_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major Islands, cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Desdemona_Isle_b_'></a><h2><b>Desdemona Isle</b></h2>
<br />
Capital - Pandæmonia:<br />
<br />
The people of the isles live a simple life. Their cities are of simple bricks and mortar, the climate scorching the land and the sea breezes eroding the stone of the mountains. Most Necra's (natives of the Isles de Mortis) dwellings are of a simple and basic design.<br />
<br />
Therefore, when I say Pandæmonia is alien to the landscape of these lands, I mean it is nothing like any human, or even the Necra's could have ever constructed. This is the City of the Gods and within it is a smaller region of the city the Necra's call the Necropolis. It is situated within the walls of Pandæmonia and upon the eastern shore of the Gia River. Here the Keepers dwell and serve the Master of the Necropolis, who is unknown to the simple <a title="Necra" href='Necra.html' class='wiki'>Necra</a> people.<br />
<br />
The Temple of their God, <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>, lies north of the Necropolis and in the centre of the Lake of the Dead. A foreboding structure that can only be reached via the <a title="Ferryman" href='Ferryman.html' class='wiki'>Ferryman</a>. The Ferryman protects whoever boards his vessel from the Undead who inhabit the Lake. He serves <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> personally, and his soul is bound to the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>. He is doomed to serve as the Ferryman for a millennium.<br />
<br />
On the western bank of the Gia the Necra's live. They are a humanoid race made by the Djinn of Death. This entire area is the City of Pandæmonia, a solid black wall encircling the city. The buildings are in a similar design to those in the Necropolis and Apollyon's temple; pillared with thick walls, domed turrets and black marble steps, the echoes of the priests choirs like whispers of the souls of the dead in the streets, emanating from the great cathedrals where the Necra's worship their dark God.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Stygian_Marshes_b_'></a><h2><b>Stygian Marshes</b></h2>
<br />
North of the city of Pandæmonia, along the foothills of the Mountains of Cerber, are the Stygian Marshes. Zombies roam these foul, foggy and dank marshes along with other fell beasts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Isle_of_Sarissa_b_'></a><h2><b>Isle of Sarissa</b></h2>
<br />
<a name='_b_Acheron_b_'></a><h2><b>Acheron</b></h2>
<br />
The Gate of the Gods. A symbol of Apollyon's power, this city houses the Gate of <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>. In the bottom of a valley it lies, dark and forlorn. Only the <a title="Necra" href='Necra.html' class='wiki'>Necra</a> Priests and the Keepers are allowed to enter the city. Therein lies few houses or buildings, just one structure dominating the valley.<br />
<br />
A stone circle set deep into the ground, so the thickness of the circle is hidden. Inside it is a pool of water, and glowing runes mark the circumference of the stone circle, runes not even the priests can translate. The pool is a whirlpool that shows no reflection. The water is of a purple hue and forever swirling within the stone circle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Isle_of_Dana_b_'></a><h2><b>Isle of Dana</b></h2>
<br />
<a name='_b_Erebus_b_'></a><h2><b>Erebus:</b></h2>
<br />
A Pirate Port. The isles are a haven for Pirates and the Slave Traders. The Necra's are the main buyers of slaves and it is believed the Slave Trade was first established on the Isle of Dana. Erebus is a port, and a gloomy one at that. Which, considering the trade that goes on, the cries of children and all kinds of slaves near death - it is not surprising. When pirates roam free and the main commodity is people as slaves, it was never going to be a pleasant place.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lethecocytus_b_'></a><h2><b>Lethecocytus</b></h2>
<br />
The main city of the Necra's and is regarded as the second capital. Pandæmonia is seen as the religious capital, Lethe is the economic capital and where Necra's live mainly. More cosmopolitan and bustling then Pandæmonia, where the City of the Gods is subservient, docile and religious - Lethe is brimming with life, busy, but not over zealous. The Necra's are not exactly the life and soul of the party and their sense of humour is rather limited and their sense of fun very strange indeed.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dis_b_'></a><h2><b>Dis</b></h2>
<br />
City of the Dead. This is a City where the bodies of the dead enter the Necra Afterlife. No living soul (apart from the Keepers) have ever entered Dis. It is situated in a box canyon in the deep south of the Isle of Dana. It can only be reached through a narrow ravine which is guarded by the Keepers. The people deliver the dead, travelling from all over the Islands to lay their loved ones to rest here. They hand them over to the Keepers at the Gates of Dis and watch them pass into the foggy expanses f the dark city.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Isle_of_Chel_b_'></a><h2><b>Isle of Chel</b></h2>
<br />
The Asphodel Meadows and the Elysian Fields are the east and west stretches of this island. These are the farm lands of the Isles and supply the people which food. The eastern meadows and the western fields or always fruitful and fertile and have never seen a poor harvest. This is an enigma for a group of Islands whose power lies in death.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Isle_of_Kyoklys_b_'></a><h2><b>Isle of Kyoklys</b></h2>
<br />
One of the most easterly islands, Kyoklys is a more relaxed place. The Necra's here are still deeply religious, worshipping and respecting death, but not in a morbid manner. They are more sympathetic and more human then the rest of their people. It is rumoured that a faction of rebels operates here, hiding in its many sea coves and catacombs that spider like a web beneath the island. Fifty miles from the next nearest Isle of Mortis, this island remains somewhat independent and does not deal with Pirates or Slaves.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
The Isle de Mortis is a group of islands hundreds of miles south east off Stalacia. The isles stretch from the north west to the deep south and eastern reaches of the Nether Realm. They are small islands, and only a few miles apart (except for Kyoklys which is almost fifty miles off the south eastern coast of Desdemona.) These Isles are a close knit group of Islands, whose people are deeply steeped in their extreme religion.<br />
<br />
The people of the Isle de Mortis are not human. They are merely a humanoid looking race with many of the attributes of humans, such as procreation, physiology and nature. They are a human looking race created by the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>. Similar to their cousins, the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> - who are an <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> made race - their beliefs mimic that of the Vigilia yet their culture is more zealous and extreme religiously. They are more restricted, submissive and autonomous then the Vigilia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
The Keepers rules the Islands and beneath them in the hierarchy are the Necra Priests who serve in Apollyon's Temple. The Mortis Warriors are the peace keepers and army of the Necra's, whilst the common people populate the small isles. The population of the isles does not rise or fall. It has been constantly at around 20,000 for five millennia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
Apollyon is their god.<br />
<br />
They believe in Death, and that through <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> they are reborn into the world. The Necra's always dress in black robes and wear skull masks during the day. Sunset marks the passing of souls into <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> the rise of the Moon is symbolic of rebirth. At night their masks come off ad they sing the Hymns of Passing all night. Necra's do not require a lot of sleep, but when they do it is always in the hours between dawn and midday. They replace their masks when the sun reaches its zenith. They are a spiritual people with extreme beliefs that fuel their society. They believe they are the Chosen, and that all souls belong to <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>. They serve him faithfully and without question. Whatever he, the Priests or the Keepers say they will obey and believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
<ul><li> All Necra's must wear skull masks during the appointed times.
</li><li> Non Necra's and visitors to the Isles must paint their faces white.
</li><li> Crime is punished by banishment to the Marshes. The Keepers are the Judges and executors of the banishments. They escort offenders the Stygian.
</li><li> All must worship Apollyon. Those that do not will be sacrificed in his temple, their souls bound to the Djinn. (It is rumoured that the people of Kyoklys worship another Djinn, but even Apollyon has not been able to find evidence of this. This could be because they are under another's protection).
</li><li> Every seventh day every soul must throw a silver mark into the ocean for the Ferryman. As all islands have no village or town more then ten miles from the coast this is done without fail and is punished if it is not done.
</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
Trade - slaves.<br />
<br />
Currency - people, gold and gemstones that are mined on the various islands as well as found in the rivers. The Rivers of the Isles provide riches in their river beds, bringing them down from the mountains. In the shallow parts many Necra's sift through the river bed to uncover the gems.<br />
<br />
Extra Info: The Ferryman is not loyal to Apollyon. Only bound to him.<br />
