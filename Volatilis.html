She cannot do anything without a majority vote from the Heads of Houses. These leaders of the higher nobles are the Senate and have a lot of say in the governing of Volatilis.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h2><b>Religion and Culture</b></h2>
<br />

The Temple of Terah lies on the outskirts of the city, a lone floating isle connected to the palace via a narrow bridge. All Alatus worship Terah and pay their tributes to the temple. The priestesses of Terah are rarely seen outside of the temple.<br />

<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h2><b>Trade and Currency</b></h2>
<br />
The currency of Volatilis is coin. Gold, silver and bronze royal marks pass the hands of its denizens, along with jewels.<br />
<br />
Trade between other races is limited. Those who can reach Volatilis find trade difficult unless it is a rare item and something the Alatus like. They have their own plantations, both on the floating city and on the land. Alatus Merchants are generally the ones who trade in the city, as they barter on the land and retrieve their goods from their mines, farms and market towns.<br />
<br />

Volatilis is a city state, but has a fifty mile perimeter of green lands/plains. It is here many commoners live outside of the city walls, and beyond the slums, and many tend the farms which are the palace farms.<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_Social_Quarter_b_'></a><h2><b>Social Quarter</b></h2>
<br />
Here many of Volatilis normal inhabitants live and ply their trades. Theatres, sports arena's, taverns and brothels are found here.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Imperial_Quarter_b_'></a><h2><b>Imperial Quarter</b></h2>
<br />
This is the high blooded part of the city. Huge mansions and smaller palaces line the streets, and the lords and ladies of the Alatus Nobility parade their wealth.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Palace_of_the_Four_Winds_b_'></a><h2><b>Palace of the Four Winds</b></h2>
