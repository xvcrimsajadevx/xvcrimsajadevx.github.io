<br />
&quot;The queen of dragons had changed little over the aeon's, she had fallen from grace but the darkness had given her strength, beauty and vitality. She was immortal, and Eldest. Her blue scales of midnight did not change in hue unless the light was inconstant. She was perfect, her underbelly not soft like Nado's but toughened and hard with scaly armour. She was not as big as many imagined, only the length of ten horses in body,but her wing span was twice that. She lay curled, and protective of her brood, her precious eggs glowing luminescent blue and wreathed in shadow beneath her and all around her. They were the only source of light along with her crimson eyes, those of the Thyrza she had become glowed beneath her horned brow, her skull housing her white jaw and deadly teeth, her nostrils flaring with shadow fire and annoyance at being disturbed. Her tail was wrapped protectively around her eggs and body, drawing them closer to her, the ridges on her spine and the ends of her tail only shadows in this half light, this malevolent hue that wreaked of death to those who threatened the dragon queen and her babies. Her wings obscured most of her torso, but the blue blood that was a shade lighter then her scales could be seen flowing through the veins in those translucent wings, pulsing quickly as her anger and frustration rose.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was once beautiful, perfect, her blue scales shimmering in the sunlight, her sapphire eyes beholding the wonder of creation, the first eyes to see the worlds in all their glory and youth. No longer did her scales gleam with health and vitality, they were dull but strong, scarred and battered. She was far too thin as well, but still bigger then any of the other female dragons in existence. She was lean, are length was fifty feet from snout to tail, and her wingspan just shy of that. Her wings fulfilled their function but were not things of beauty. The tears from her ordeal in the ocean remained and could never be healed. They would stay as a reminder of her failure and defeat. The madness in her dull blue eyes danced and raged, her claws sharpened and her teeth stained with the blood of her kin, the Obsidian elves and anything else that wondered into her lair.<br />
<br />
Her scales have not seen the sunshine for many long years and her squalor of a cave has little light. If one was to look upon her in her full glory in the light one would think they were in hell...<br />
<br />
<b>Personal History:</b><br />
<br />
The soul of the dragon queen came forth from Tempest, born of the wind, the rain and the thunder. She was the other half of Nado, their minds as one in the beginning; one in thought, in purpose and in creation. How long they existed this way there is no way of knowing for sure. Yet, the dragon queen remembers the grief of their first parting, and also the joy she felt at coming together again when they began the creation of more of their race.<br />
<br />
They awoke entwined upon a mountain top, the mountain that is now called Nadozenith, but was once called Drakkenpeak. Their Goddess, Tempest observed from her place in the heavens as her firstborn, the Eldest of all creatures of all worlds, took to the unformed skies for the first time. They raged with the storms, their agony at being apart in body and mind tore at their hearts, which would forever be asunder. Their roars became the thunder, their tears the first rains and their life force the sparks of lightening that flashed back and forth in the dark skies.<br />
<br />
When Tiamat bore her first children some of that agony was healed. Her children propagated the skies long before the other races walked the land and swam in the seas. Her children rule the heavens though and dwelt upon the mountains. As they became more numerous some dragons left Drakkenpeak, and so the first of the Kindred’s came into being. Those who left their birth place evolved and changed, but always they resembled their mother and father, their wings and serpentine bodies varied, yet their hearts and minds and majick belonged to Tempest and to Nado and their mother, their queen, Tiamat. She was able to bear their leaving has she had more children to raise and her twin, her other half, her Nado was with her, and all was well.<br />
<br />
When Humes came into the world everything changed and Tiamat never forgave them for this. Death followed the children of the Light, and it consumed the Nether Realm. Death was the plague of all, even the mighty dragons. Perhaps if death had been the only curse that her children had to bear she may have retained her forgiving heart and benevolent nature. Yet worse was to come. For the queen and her daughters the curse of infertility fell upon them. Tiamat raged and her roar brought down mountains! She begged tempest to heal her, not her daughters, just her, but her Goddess heard her not. The Origin had deserted her children, in the throes of her own despair she left them to roar and rage and weep. In the far reaches of existence the Origin sealed herself away, distraught by the curse that had befallen her precious children.<br />
<br />
As the centuries past Tiamat grew ever more hateful. Her children were dying, killed by the world and by their own stupidity and arrogance. Her younglings grew and soon all the eggs had hatched and she was left with nothing but her own venomous fury. She became jealous of Nado, furious that she had been cursed and not he! Her jealousy and anger severed her mind from him and slowly darkness enveloped her heart, replacing her love for her children and her god. She felt she had been betrayed and deserted, and so when the opportunity came for revenge and redemption she took it eagerly and greedily.<br />
<br />
She betrayed her race sacrificing them so she could bare children again. They were a dark and twisted version of the pure creatures she had birthed in the beginning, but she saw a dark beauty in their hearts and loved them as she had ever loved her children. Her soul belonged to the darkness and was tainted, yet Nado did not notice a change, a mistake he would pay for dearly.<br />
<br />
She revealed her black and twisted heart when she revolted. Her revolution was on two fronts; from the inside through the Cyclonia Kindred, and from the outside through her new Dark Kindred, the Shadowinds. They attacked Drakkenpeak and killed many of the first children of Nado and Tiamat. It was in this brutal war that she revealed herself as a Thyrza, and when she knew she could do no more, and was satisfied that she had done enough damage she fled with her surviving dragons and returned to her secret aeries on the Dark Continent.<br />
<br />
In the following centuries she rarely left her fortified aerie. When she did stir abroad it was to rain destruction upon the Nether Realm. In her wake she left darkness, devastation and despair and many feared her and her dark dragons. In her pride she became complacent and attempted a foolish raid upon the Azail in Azaliz. Her Cyclonia Kindred were easily defeated by the Race of Azure and many of her children fled north towards their dark home. The Queen had been abandoned by her cowardly brood and was alone facing the King and Queen of the Azail. Ahto and Elektra gave their lives to protect their city, and their deaths were the final part of the spell that bound Tiamat to the ocean and imprisoned her in a watery dungeon. There she remained for centuries, left to rot in the depths of the dark ocean, left to go insane beneath the waves of Azures waters. When she finally escaped, with the help of another Thyrza, she emerged a shadow of her former glory. In the battle with the Azail her wings were broken and what bore her above the waves now were tattered and weak. She struggled to remain airborne and barely reached her distant home, but reach it she did and from there she did not stir for millennia.<br />
<br />
Paranoid, angry, and ashamed the queen of the dragons dared not to fly, would not see or speak to another soul for centuries. When she finally allowed the Thyrza Obscurum and Shiloh to come to her she had descended into a dark and wretched creature, as twisted as the beasts she now produced. They convinced her to take up her rule again and re-establish her dragons as a dominant force, but instead she gave that responsibility to the Obsidian Elves. While she had been imprisoned they had raised her children and used them for their own ends. Only the Shadowinds had refused to obey the elves and they aided their Queen in her recovery. It was too late to heal her fully, but many of the strongest and wisest of her Shadowinds managed to heal her wings so she could fly. She had lost her beauty but regained her strength. The numbers of the dark Kindred’s grew once more, but it is believed that Tiamat has never left her aerie since returning after her imprisonment. She has sworn vengeance against the Azail, uttering an oath sealed with her own blood that she will utterly destroy them.<br />
<br />
<b>Aims &amp; Allies</b><br />
<br />
Tiamat’s aims are threefold;<br />
<br />
• Exponentially increase her dragon numbers.<br />
<br />
• Vanquish her enemies (Nado, Azail, Abraxis, etc)<br />
<br />
• Fulfil her duty as a Thyrza<br />
<br />
These aims are in the order she deems important, which is often a bone of contention between herself and other Thyrza. Her allies within the ranks of the Thyrza shift according to need and mood. Obscurum has always had a civil relationship with her and she will abide his counsel most of the time. Shiloh is the only other Thyrza she will deign to listen too. She has a deep mistrust for all Thyrza, but none more so then Apollyon. Shiloh, Obscurum and Tiamat have entered a pact; they have agreed to strive to control Apollyon and steer him towards either;<br />
<br />
• His own downfall<br />
Or -<br />
• His true purpose as a Thyrza.<br />
<br />
She has had several Adair during her time as a Minion but all have thus far disappointed and failed her. She had high hopes for her latest Adair, the first Obsidian Elf she has raised to this status, Ilshara Bladedancer. In recent years the elf had evoked much suspicion from her master. Some would say unfairly so, as in Tiamat’s madness she has deemed the elf ‘too loyal’ and ‘too obedient’. Her suspicions were briefly alleviated when the young elf disobeyed her and was promptly demoted to Captain of the Shadowinds, but her paranoia has won out and she had decided to test the Adair. Sending her on what seems like a fool’s errand is in fact a test of Ilshara’s devotion and her own ambition.<br />
<br />
<b>Birthing &amp; Kindred’s:</b><br />
<br />
Recently Tiamat has concentrated on not only Birthing but on creating new Kindred’s. She uses the tunnels that connect the Birthing Aeries to succour her eggs and change them. For many centuries her eggs and offspring were the most intelligent of the Dark Kindred’s and almost always of the Shadowind Kindred; of late though this is becoming rarer.<br />
<br />
<b>Current Status:</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Tiamat is going insane.<br />
<br />
This may not be very surprising as after her return she was extremely paranoid and divided. This was the catalyst to her insanity, but recently she has been getting drastically worse.<br />
<br />
She is two. One is the Thyrza, the Dragon Queen; coherent, malevolent and cunning. This Tiamat is quickly being drowned out by the second, the obsessive, paranoid and mournful mess of a creature. In her lucid periods she suspects something is wrong, but cannot heal her mind. In the back of her mind she believes that some long dormant repercussion of separating from Nado completely is finally surfacing and taking its toll. She suspects that her subconscious is trying to compensate, but in truth there is something far more sinister going on.<br />
