The centaurs are creatures that are part human and part horse. They have the torso and head of a human, and the body of a horse. The human part of them is that of a topless man or woman. They have no shame when it comes to this kind of nudity, and embrace the nature of their form. Blonde, dark, red headed male and female centaurs propagate <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a>, their horse part often reflecting and complimenting their human parts. A blonde headed blue eyed Centaur would often have a white or beige horse flesh, and a blonde tail, for example.<br />
<br />

<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
The personalities of Centaurs varies. Some are mystic and reflective, pondering the wonders of the Universe and tending nature. Others are archers, hunters and warriors, depending on their mood, the state of the world and those who enter their land. They are a curious race, but a very un-trusting one too. They love the earth and their connection to it and <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> keeps them protected and keeps them unified.<br />

The tales of the Centaurs are told only by <a title="wizards" href='wizards.html' class='wiki'>wizards</a>, as this race will not suffer any other type of human or race to enter their land, <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a>. The only other exception to this rule are the Unicorns<a href="" title="Create page: Unicorns"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are believed to be the most divine of creatures and Centaurs will protect them with their lives. Unicorn dales in <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a> are home to the most numerous wild herds of Unicorns<a href="" title="Create page: Unicorns"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> in the entire Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />

</div><a name='_b_Most_notable_Centaurs_b_'></a><h1><b>Most notable Centaurs</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Ciern_b_'></a><h2><b>Ciern</b></h2>
<br />
Ciern was known for his exceptional goodness and wisdom. He was the first Centaur to leave <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a> and he became the tutor of earth magic on the <a title="Wizarding Isles" href='Wizarding+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Wizarding Isles</a>. He was a master of the stars and the heavens and taught early wizards the secrets of his people. In <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a> his name is blotted out, but wizards are allowed to enter Terra because of this act. They are seen as cousins and are respected by the Centaurs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Euryt_b_'></a><h2><b>Euryt</b></h2>
<br />
Led the Centaurs in the battle against the dark wolves. He went as far as Hazar Shual<a href="" title="Create page: Hazar+Shual"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>'s sacred valley, believing the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> to be the maker of the minions. Euryt was taken prisoner by the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, and returned to his warriors seven days later. He led them back to <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a> but never spoke of his meeting with Hazar Shual<a href="" title="Create page: Hazar+Shual"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Centuries later, an aged Euryt was called to battle by the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>. They fought side by side against the dark hounds, but Euryt fell in battle. Even to this day young Centaurs offer their bow and blade to Hazar Shual<a href="" title="Create page: Hazar+Shual"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Ixion_b_'></a><h2><b>Ixion</b></h2>
<br />
The current leader of the Centaurs. Every Centaur is subject to him, but he does not elevate himself as a king or emperor. He is merely the representative of his race to others.<br />
<br />
<a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a> is a land where nature flourishes. Its beauty is marvelled by all who come upon it, and worshipped by the Centaurs who tend it. They have but one city, te'Knossos. The city itself is in the centre of a labyrinth which only the chosen can navigate.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Centaur_Herds_b_'></a><h1><b>Centaur Herds</b></h1>
<br />
