<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b><br />
<br />
All over the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, mainly inhabiting mountains though.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b><br />
<br />
As one of the first races, they can only be killed in battle or by the Curse of the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, which manifests itself as the Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
After eggs are laid they can hatch a long time afterwards. Some can take over a thousand years before they hatch.<br />
<br />
Now the Birthing<a href="" title="Create page: Birthing"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> takes place every 100 years, but not many eggs are laid because females are so few and are hunted by the Minions<a href="" title="Create page: Minions"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The Birthing<a href="" title="Create page: Birthing"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> fight for dominance.<br />
<br />
It is important to note each dragon matures and grows at different rates. Some remain younglings for hundreds of years, some only for a few. Their rate of learning depends on the individual too, and some kindreds are able to communicate verbally within a few months of hatching. It is rumoured there are even Kindred's who have genetic memory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Kindred_Appearances_b_'></a><h2><b>Kindred Appearances:</b></h2>
<br />
Not all dragons appear as their kindreds do. Due to the Dwindling many drakes are mixed blood, but they tend to have aspects of their mixed kindreds if they are not full blooded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Stormbreaker Dragons:</b><br />
<br />
They come in all shapes and sizes, both male and female. As all the male dragons from the other Kindreds come to Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> to mate with the Stormbreaker females (who are also from all kindreds) the offspring come in all forms. Anyone making a dragon character that wants freedom in the way they look should make a Stormbreaker.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Silvermyst:</b><br />
<br />
Always white dragons, and cold in nature, it is as if the environment has moulded them. They have long serpantine bodies, short legs and see-through, bat-like wings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>BlackWing:</b><br />
<br />
They are blue dragons and very friendly. Battle Dragons, they are very brave and extremely tough. They have thick scales and as their names suggests, black wings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Everpeak:</b><br />
<br />
The Everpeak Dragons tend to have golden and red scales, wide bodies and long, red eyebrows stretching to the ground. Their claws are long and sharp, and their wings wide and transparent with veins of red flowing through them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Ananta:</b><br />
<br />
They are small dragons, only the height of two men and the length of three horses. Their wings are large and their scales soft. They come in all colours and mixtures, but their trademark is their curled horns either side of their albino eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Thunderdrake:</b><br />
<br />
No one knows what these dragons look like any more. They were once the most beautiful of dragons, the males pure golden dragons and the females silver. Their huge bodies were born by wings that spanned three times the lengths of their body. They are known amongst dragons has the 'Amani' which means 'the Sacred Ones'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Windspike:</b><br />
<br />
The Windspikes are fearsome creatures, unrelenting in battle. With spikes on their tails, and their heads, and green scales.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Shadowind:</b><br />
<br />
Black dragons, with pools of midnight for eyes and bat-like wings that are edged with spikes, tails that have poisonous spikes at the end and horns that protrude from their brows.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Venomwings:</b><br />
<br />
This dark kindred are thin, with dark green scales and a wings span three times their length. they come in all sizes but the females are always larger then the males.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Cyclonia:</b><br />
<br />
They have webbed claws and serpentine bodies. They can fly but prefer to swim. They rebelled with Tiamat thousands of years ago and follow her. They do not live on the dark Continent for the most part, they terrorise the Azail in the waters of the Nether Realm<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Malia</b><br />
<br />
Their size rivals that of the Everpeaks and they are war machines. Their scales are a thick, natural armour and their spine and tails have poison tip spikes. And when I say tails I mean tails. They have three of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Darkfangs</b><br />
<br />
This Kindred tend to be very small and not able to support a rider. They are jet black with black fangs also and it is believed they are bred in the Abyss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
Every Kindred varies but all dragons are blessed with the wisdom of their Kindred. Some are more ferocious then others, but as a rules they do not harm humans. You have exceptions of course, but an army of dragons (unless they are from the dark continent) would never attack humans or fight them in battle.<br />
<br />
The Stormbreakers are generally quite docile, protective of their Kin. The Silvermysts are xenophobic and hate outsiders. The BlackWings<a href="" title="Create page: BlackWings" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are friendly and ferocious in battle. The Everpeaks are similar to the Stormbreakers, but are more adventurous and have the need to travel more. They are good friends with <a title="Centaurs" href='Centaurs.html' class='wiki'>Centaurs</a>. The Ananta are book worms and value knowledge. The Thunderdrakes are legend, rumoured to be the most powerful wielders of the Air majicks they once had a city dedicated to the Air Origin, but now its location and existence are lost in memory and fable. The Windspikes are loyal first and foremost. They will die in defence of summoners.<br />
<br />

<a name='History'></a><h1>History</h1><a id="flipperid995723" class="link" href="javascript:flipWithSign('id995723')">[+]</a><div id="id995723" style="display:none;">
<br />
<a title="Nado" href='Nado.html' class='wiki'>Nado</a> was the first creature of <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> to be made, the oldest living soul in the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The dragon king and his queen, <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a>, are the mother and father of all dragons. Through the millennia they spread all over the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, splitting into Kindreds. The Kindred Leaders are the first dragons to hatch from <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a>'s eggs. The dragons suffered the Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, but were unable to abate it, all females being infertile, the only new dragons came from the original eggs <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> had given birth to.<br />
<br />
When <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> betrayed them (some believe because she was so devastated by the curse, she chose the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> so it could be lifted), and so many females died, the Dragon Queen was banished to the ocean and in the fight that ensued the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> King and Queen died, sealing her in her prison. This strained relations with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>, an alliance broken and trust gone. The only Kindred the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> trust are the Aquius, the dragons Kindred who evolved into swimmers.<br />
<br />
The Thunderdrakes gathered the surviving female dragons and then disappeared from history, most believing them to be annihilated by the Minions. In truth they his in Gallian<a href="" title="Create page: Gallian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, the mountainous country and lived with the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a> in and around Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Upon Tiamat's escape the dragons came out of their isolation and vowed to protect the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> from her evil. All but the female Thunderdrakes took to the skies. The Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> still made it difficult for females to give birth, but Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> became a haven for them. Many eggs were laid in the years after 3000E, but many dragons were killed outside of Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The constant threat of culling made them hide mostly in the mountains throughout the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, fiercely protecting each other. The biggest blow and greatest sadness comes from the fact that it is Black Kindreds, children of the Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> that hunt them and destroy them. A great war has waged between them, and now <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> is once again free, she has rejoined the dragons which the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> have been breeding for her. A great army is ready to sweep the Nether Realm<a href="" title="Create page: Nether+Realm"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and blot out the sun - and their first business lies with their cousins of the Light, the Kindreds and the Dragons King, Nado.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</div><a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
TNR dragons <b>DO NOT BREATHE FIRE</b> under ANY circumstances.<br />
<br />
Most Dragons can only use Air Majicks, of the Origin <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>, but some new/newer Kindreds have varied abilities, some that have never been seen before (still no fire breathing).<br />
<br />
The older the dragon is the more adept they will be with these powers. For instance, <a title="Nado" href='Nado.html' class='wiki'>Nado</a> (the King) could cover an entire continent with a storm, a 100 year old dragon could perhaps cover a small village. Its like with most things in life, the older the wiser. Some dragons develop new abilities with age.<br />
<br />
An example of dragon spells are:<br />
<br />
<b>Control Weather</b> - rainstorms, clear skies, blizzards, and lightening, they can control all weather<br />
<br />
<b>Summon Tornado</b> - summon a twister/s, varies in size and number depending on age and strength of dragon<br />
<br />
<b>Blast of Air</b> - a telekinetic ball of air that flies from their mouths when they roar.<br />
<br />
<b>Lightning Strike</b> - can control lightning bolts and use them to strike their enemies down. A storm is not needed to utilise this ability, but a storm will come as a result of employing this magic as the natural air conditions being adjusted cause the storm.<br />
<br />
<b>Roar of Thunder</b> - Another spell, this one sends a high frequency vibration that can shatter anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Added_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Added Information</b></h1>
<br />
The dragons of the Nether Realm are a cross between the eastern and western mythologies. They are divine like in the east, and some Kindred's look as the ancient Chinese dragons, or at least have some of their attributes. Dragons in this world are not fire breathing, they are the oldest race of the Air Origin <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> and control the skies... The young are protected and the females hidden. For the survival of their race their females must survive...<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='The_Birthing_of_Dragons'></a><h1>The Birthing of Dragons</h1><a id="flipperid645" class="link" href="javascript:flipWithSign('id645')">[+]</a><div id="id645" style="display:none;">
<br />
Between 1E - 3000E All dragons that were hatched were born infertile. (except the Dark Kindreds of course). Before the curse MANY eggs were laid by <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a>. These hatched every 100 years in this time period (between 1E and 3000E). And so, the number of eggs dwindled in these 3000 years, as no dragons were laying new eggs (hence the name of the dragons curse). As dragons were being killed in battle and hunted by Minion's too the original progeny dwindled too.<br />
<br />
AFTER 3000E All females become fertile, even the original progeny and those born before this time. But - there is a catch. Firstly, 95% of the females who dwelt with their Kindreds outside of Nadozenith died from the new form of the Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Curse. The remaining 5% were brought to Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> hastily (mainly under the protection of the thunderdrakes).<br />
<br />
The eggs BIRTHED by the Silvermysts, Blackwings, Everpeaks, Ananta's, Windspike's, and Aquius Kindreds MUST be hatched on Nadozenith, because of this new curse. Those females who lay their eggs outside of Nadozenith must take their eggs to the great mountain to ensue the survival of their young. Many Kindred Leader's send their females to Nadozenith and mate with them there to ensue the surival of both female and the young.<br />
<br />
Thunderdrake's and Stormbreaker's escaped the curse the second time around. They can lay their eggs and have their eggs hatch anywhere. Cross Kindred eggs are therefore common as many kindreds have female Thunderdrake and sometimes Stormbreaker's with them to bare their children in their Kindred territories. This is how many dragons are born outside of the great mountain.<br />
<br />
Of these eggs that hatch outside of Nadozenith belonging to the females of the Silvermysts, Blackwings, Everpeaks, Ananta's, Windspike's, and Aquius Kindreds only male younglings can survive. Females born outside die within a few years and are ALWAYS infertile. It does not matter if the father was a Thunderdrake or a Stormbreaker. The survival of the young is wholly dependant upon the mother's Kindred. If she is a cross-kindred, her Thunderdrake or Stormbreaker blood will ensure the survival of her young.<br />
<br />
Any females from the Silvermysts, Blackwings, Everpeaks, Ananta's, Windspike's, and Aquius Kindreds who lay their eggs outside will die very quickly. If their eggs are taken to Nadozenith and are hatched there, then they will live. As I said, it is important to remember this - ONLY MALE DRAGONS WITH MOTHERS FROM THESE KINDREDS CAN HATCH OUTSIDE OF NADOZENITH AND LIVE. It is very risky to hatch eggs outside by choice as there is no way of determining the sex of the egg. You may be dooming a female to death. This is why most females are forced to lay and hatch their eggs on the great mountain, it is becoming a place of life and a haven for female dragons.<br />
<br />
For example - A female Silvermyst lays her eggs in a solitary Ice Cavern on the Ice Continent. She is completely alone and no one knows she is there. She dies soon after birthing her eggs, not being able to get to the mountain on time. Her eggs are not taken to Nadozenith either. 100 years later (as with all dragons their eggs hatch at least 100 years later, sometimes many many centuries after they were birthed) 4 of the 8 eggs hatch, and three of these hatchlings are female Silvermysts, 1 is a male. The females die withing 20 years, all are born infertile. The male survives.<br />
<br />
100 years after the first eggs hatched, and 200 years after their poor mothers death, the final four hatch. 2 are female Silvermysts, and 2 are male. The two females once again die within 20 years of hatching, and the 2 males survive.<br />
<br />
Of the 8 eggs the 3 male Silvermysts survived whereas the 5 female's are dead, along with their mother. If she had given birth on Nadozenith, even if the father had been a Silvermyst, ALL of her female and male eggs would have hatched and survived and she would STILL BE ALIVE.<br />
<br />
The sickness, the New Dwindling and form of the original curse, only kicks in once they give birth outside of Nadozenith.<br />
<br />
If the eggs hatched are female and they are taken to the mountain after they have hatched, there is no hope for them. They will die regardless.<br />
<br />
Females from these cursed Kindreds (who have laid and hatched their eggs on the mountain) will often leave Nadozenith with their young and return to their Kindred if they are given permission to leave the mountain by their Kindred leaders. At times in the dragons history this permission has been withdrawn with the hope of preserving the females. The male young will be taken by their male elders and taken back to their Kindreds, but the females have often times been told to remain there for their own safety. This is not to say that they adhere to this, they are after all individuals and it is by no means LAW that they should remain on the mountain. For this reason Nado has commanded most of his own females from his Kindred to never leave the mountain so as to preserve the female of his species.<br />
<br />
It should be noted - Females other then the Thunderdrake's and Stormbreaker's who give birth outside and make it to Nadozenith before the sickness kills them WILL survive BUT - they cannot leave without becoming sick again very quickly. They must remain on Nadozenith forever to keep the sickness from claiming them. If they leave and do not return it is because the curse has claimed them. These females are also infertile, another blow to giving birth outside for the unprotected Kindreds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormbreaker females: Most remain on the mountain with their Kindred Leader, Nado. Many males from the other kindreds will travel to Nadozenith to mate with Stormbreaker Females and take the eggs so they can hatch back in their Kindred territories.<br />
<br />
<br />
These Stormbreaker Females, as I have stated previously, are kept and protected on the mountain to ensue the survival of their race. (Thunderdrakes are hidden in the mountains of Gallian<a href="" title="Create page: Gallian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and in other Kindreds for the same reason.) Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is the most protected area and blessed by <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>, as well as being the home of Nado the Dragon King who bears the jewel of Orion<a href="" title="Create page: Orion"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> (the Light Bearer<a href="" title="Create page: Light+Bearer"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> who partly healed the dragons Infertility). If all females outside of this sacred mountain range are murdered and taken by the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, then at least some females remain to give birth to the next generation of Dragons.<br />
<br />
The Dark Minions know this and this is why they hunt the females outside of Nadozenith. Thunderdrakes are the main target, of course, and the most hunted of all dragons....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</div><a name='_b_Dragon_Kindreds_b_'></a><h1><b>Dragon Kindreds</b></h1>
<br />
All dragons are descendants of the first Kin, Stormbreakers, <a title="Nado" href='Nado.html' class='wiki'>Nado</a> and <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> the mother and father of all dragons. Following is a list of the most numerous and prominent Kindreds, but there are many smaller one's throughout the Nether Realm, and new Kindred's come about from time to time. Not all dragons have to be part of a kindred, as not all kindreds are known.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Stormbreaker_b_'></a><h2><b>Stormbreaker</b></h2>
<br />
Dragons come in all shapes and sizes, and both male and female. The other Kindreds come to Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> (in the land of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>) to mate with Stormbreaker females. Some dragons take the eggs back to their kindreds. If a female is born they always return with the wyrm (baby dragon)<br />
<br />
But over the centuries they have spread all over the Nether Realm, away from their birthplace of Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and have formed their owns Kindred's.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Silvermyst_b_'></a><h2><b>Silvermyst</b></h2>
<br />
The Father of this Kindred is Iryth Silvermyst<br />
<br />

Always white dragons, and cold in nature, it is as if the environment has moulded them. They have long serpantine bodies, short legs and see-through, bat-like wings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_BlackWing_b_'></a><h2><b>BlackWing</b></h2>

They are blue dragons and very friendly. They will protect humans, and like humans. Battle Dragons, the Blackwings have been at all the important battles of the Nether Realm, on the front line. Very brave and extremely tough. They have thick scales and as their names suggests, black wings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Everpeak_b_'></a><h2><b>Everpeak</b></h2>
<br />
The Father of this Kindred is Danuth Everpeak<br />
<br />
The Everpeak Kindred live in the tallest mountains of the Nether Realm, in the Northern reaches of the Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They have good relations with the <a title="Centaurs" href='Centaurs.html' class='wiki'>Centaurs</a> of <a title="Terra" href='Terra.html' class='wiki'>Terra</a> but do not associate with any other race. Nado visits here often as Danuth is his second in command. The Everpeak Dragons tend to have golden and red scales, wide bodies and long, red eyebrows stretching to the ground. Their claws are long and sharp, and their wings wide and transparent with veins of red flowing through them.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The Father of this Kindred is Iatineth Thunderdrake<br />
<br />
The Thunderdrakes are mysterious and all but forgotten. They vanished millennia ago and it is rumoured they have taken to the secret city of the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a>. No one knows what these dragons look like any more, as they were once of Nado's Kin, having searched the Nether Realm for female dragons to protect and preserve them, when all were gathered at Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> they departed. They are known amongst dragons has the 'Amani' which means 'the Sacred Ones'.<br />

<a name='_b_The_Dwindling_b_'></a><h1><b>The Dwindling</b></h1>
<br />
All races of the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> are cursed with death. And even though the Dragons are all but immortal, they will live forever if they are not killed in battle.<br />
<br />
But the curse manifested itself another way with them. They call it, The Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Even though the Dragons escaped the full blow of the Curse of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, after the races of the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> were hexed, no more dragons were born. The females could not lay eggs, meaning the dragons that had already been born were all there was of their race, along with the eggs of <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> that had not been hatched.<br />
<br />
For 3,000 years the Dragons dwindled. Still able to be killed, and hunted by foul creatures of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, their numbers decreased. The long lives of dragons meant those that survived the purging would live to see the end of their race. This caused great sadness. The dragons retreated to the highest mountains, away from death and destruction. Some believe it is this sadness that caused their Queen, <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> to rebel. By becoming a Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> the curse was lifted, and she was once again able to bear children.<br />
<br />
Then, one day, an elf came to Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, bearing a jewel. This elf was the Light Bearer<a href="" title="Create page: Light+Bearer"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Orion<a href="" title="Create page: Orion"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and he gave the jewel <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> to the Dragon King, <a title="Nado" href='Nado.html' class='wiki'>Nado</a>. The first eggs in 3,000 years were laid on that mountain. The Dwindling ceased, and for the first time in their existence, new dragons were born from eggs not laid only by <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a>. But, there was a catch. A new version of the curse arose. The female dragons became sick and all but a few died....the infertility was replaced by a sickness of the females that meant their eggs had to be hatched on Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
The Thunderdrakes set out and found every last surviving female dragon and brought them safely to Nadozenith<a href="" title="Create page: Nadozenith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. From then on, the Dwindling<a href="" title="Create page: Dwindling"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the Birthing<a href="" title="Create page: Birthing"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> fought for dominance, but with eggs only being laid once a century, and so few females left, the Dwindling was starting to take hold once more. Only the Thunderdrakes and Stormbreakers escaped the curse the second time around, most believing that Nado's Kindred had protection from him, and the Thunderdrakes because of their bravery by protecting the females in the Nether Realm so they could be safe on Nadozenith. This brave act earned them the name 'amani', meaning sacred ones, and many believed they were rewarded by both <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> and <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>.<br />
