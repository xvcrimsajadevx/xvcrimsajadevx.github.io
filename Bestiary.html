<a name='_b_Asrais_b_'></a><h2><b>Asrais</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Wraith<br />
<br />
Life Span: 150-200 years.<br />
<br />
Region: The Azaili Empire, including inland seas, freshwater lakes, rivers, anywhere underwater.<br />
<br />
Description: Their bodies are translucent, giving them the appearance of a wraith even though they are not completely spiritual essence. They are consisted of the water they live in, held within a shimmering spirit force that shapes their bodies, for this reason they have been nicknamed the &quot;sea ghost&quot;. Long, elongated faces, thin limbs and torso, the orbs of their eyes are pale and emit a subtle white glow at night. They have no vocal chords as they are made of water and have a guttural sound when they communicate. They cannot speak any coherent language.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: If they are left alone under the water then they are perfectly peaceful and do not attack unless provoked. Such provocation includes polluting their water, directing magical energy at them and trying to capture them.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They cannot live on land and are completely nocturnal. They can only be found underwater. They tend to stick to peaceful waters and deep in the darkest depths of the oceans. River Asrais are rare, but Lake Asrais have been located in very calm lakes which are surrounded by uninhabited land, such as the lakes in Shalimdor and Kalimdor.<br />
<br />
Breeding: These creatures are both male and female but they do not breed per se. When they reach the time of their expiration they find a 'mate' and fuse their essence together. Whichever spirit has the strongest essence will dominate and dictate the gender of the 'new' Asrais. When they merge they forget their past life. This process tends to occur every 150-200 years and normally in shallow waters. Some believe the reason for this is they wish to see the moon for the last time in their 'life' as it was the first thing they remembered when they came into being. The reason for this is obvious, those that merge are already viewing the moon and in the shallows so when the new Asrais emerges the first thing they see is the same moon.<br />
<br />
Their numbers are decreasing of course, with the merging. Once there were millions of them but now they are rare and rarely seen. For this reason they are hunted, everyone wants to own something that may not be around for much longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Diet: Asrais get everything they need from the water they live in. They assimilate the nutrients in the water and sustain their form by doing so.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Asrais' natural predators are humes. They are often hunted and 'fished' for which leads to these creatures avoiding populated area's. As they are not consumed and are therefore not a part of the food chain they are merely caught for sport and because humes think they are 'pretty'. Their natural defence is too blend with the water and hide but they will attack using slashing tentacles and dragging their predator into the water and drowning them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Safe unless you try to hunt them<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_Aughisky_b_'></a><h2><b>Aughisky</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Water-horse<br />
<br />
Life Span: 10-20 years<br />
<br />
Region: In the oceans, seas or huge lakes. Occasionally seen galloping along the beaches of this world.<br />
<br />
Description: They are pale blue and glistening creatures, with six legs and hooves made of sea crystal. Their mane appears as blue fire but is in fact a sea mist billowing out behind as do their tails. To touch their skin is cold and slick, and when they are in the water they part merge with it, their body becoming liquid and flowing with the waves and the tide.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: They sometimes come out of the sea and gallop along the shore or sometimes through fields. For anyone who can catch one and lead it from the shore it is a wonderful, speedy mount, but if it ever again glimpses the sea it will gallop back into the waters, carrying the rider with it and ripping it to pieces.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Free Aughisky live in the water and play on the beach. They can breath underwater having a combination of gills and lungs they come up for air and satiate their need to scrape their crystal hooves on the beaches. Captured Aughisky can live as normal horses for the most part, but they do need to be knee deep in water at night in their stalls to live. Without this they may get depressed and irritant and become untameable and violent.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Aughisky mate as normal horses do, giving birth on the beaches but can only mate when in water. Aughisky in captivity rarely breed.<br />
<br />
Diet: They can survive on horse feed but they have a healthier glow when they have a diet of seaweed.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Neither. They are neither hunted nor hunters.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: They are deadly if the rider is too close to a great expanse of water, and can be violent if they are not kept properly in stables.<br />

<a name='_b_Banshee_b_'></a><h2><b>Banshee</b></h2>
<br />
<b>THIS IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN RHEA AND PHOENIXBYRD, BUT MOST OF THIS INFO IS BY RHEA</b><br />
<br />
Type: Undead<br />
<br />
Life Span: As long as they still mourn, 400 to 700 years, the older they are the meaner and less merciful since their pain has only been eating at them for so long.<br />
<br />
Region: Wizarding Isles, Aeternis Caliga, Isles de Mortis, Lacanta Isles, The Eastern Continent, The Dark Continent, Spectral Plane<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
They are women, sometimes ghostly, sometimes they are solid. Their body's are dead. They were once very beautiful women now warped by pain and sadness, anger and regret. They can make themselves look as beautiful as they once did and lure men to their deaths, but not often does this happen. They are still wearing the clothes that they were wearing on their deathbed which also reminds them of their pain. Their clothes are torn and ragged, tear stained and dirty.<br />

<span class="img"><img alt="" src="http://phildeb.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/anima__banshee_by_wen_m.jpg" border="0"  /></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Behaviour:<br />
<br />
If left alone, the Banshee are docile, they simply mourn themselves, their own death or the death of loved ones. If provoked the banshee goes into a killing rage, dealing death to anything that moves in their path. The Banshee can be provoked by thunder and lightning storms. These storms mirror the torment inside of the Banshee. The Banshee can simply be provoked by seeing something that reminds them of their previous life or loved ones. It is very hard to tell what a Banshee will do next. They are very unpredictable. They can lure men to their deaths but normally only if that man has something to do with their sadness.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They prefer to live in places that mirror their torment. Places like swamps or desolate landscapes, cloudy places or rainy.<br />
<br />
Breeding: The Banshee are all women, they do not necessarily reproduce. The way one comes in to being, is such heartbreak one cannot imagine. They stop eating and only mourn. The woman's body dies but the heartbreak fuels their half life. Their soul is kept part in this realm, and part in another imbuing them with other worldly powers such as their screams and their ability to hover and appear ghostly.<br />
<br />
Diet: If unprovoked they require mutton or anything dead really, they like it if it has been dead for awhile. When provoked and shot into a killing spree they feed on the dead bodies they produced.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: When they hunt they mortally injure the animal/hume/being and stalk it until it is dead, sometimes for perhaps a few days, and feed upon it. If the animal/hume/being angers it, they simply swoop in on it and begin feeding while it is still alive. If anyone would dare try to hunt the Banshee, they scream, imparting fear and cowardice into the hunter's mind and heart, frightening them away. If the hunter were to have enough heart to continue hunting, the Banshee can de/un/im-materialize, leaving only the ghostly form. A hunter would need to banish the Banshee in order to rid themselves of one.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Deadly<br />
<br />
OTHER:<br />
<br />
<b>History</b><br />
<br />
The Banshee came to this realm via Morrigan. She is known to have summoned the first of the Banshee. They are not originaly of the nether realm, but they once summoned they can roam freely if they haven't been banished. Which often occurs when a majick user summons one and cannot control them properly, often resulting in their death/dismemberment/torture/etc. Thus the Banshee have free between this realm and their own.<br />
<br />
At the end of Morrigan's bitterness period (4930E) she was in a such a state, one that describes the Banshee itself in it's entirety, she actually summoned the first of the Banshee. They appeared to bye her side completely at her whim, doing as she wished in all things. She and the Banshee massacred 100 of Lenal's best elven warriors. Upon the warrior's wive's deaths, (they spent the rest of their lives mourning, which was not long as they faded quickly) Morrigan did them the only kindness she knew how and summoned their wailing souls from a separate realm/plane to her as well, letting them rest with their sweethearts in peace. These 100 wive's are Banshee when in The Nether Realm and are Morrigan's personally, none other can summon these.<br />
<br />
<b>Misc Info</b><br />
<br />
The Banshee can choose to haunt a being. If you had anything to do with something terrible that they remember from their heartbreak be sure that they will be haunted.<br />
<br />
The Banshee can be summoned from the Spectral Plane. Banshee's cannot die in this realm but can be banished. You can summon the same one twice if you have a preference and a name. If you can control your Banshee in this realm, they have to give you their name. With a name, the same Banshee can be summoned and banished by the majick user/necromancer. The length of the banishment depends upon whom banishes them, the stronger the majick user the longer the banishment.<br />
<br />
The Banshee have a feeling of right and wrong. Though it is only a feeling, if you are good but you have provoked one, be sure she will attack. Often times a Banshee will wail for someone they can feel dying within a 50 mile distance. The Banshee prefer to eat dead animals but will eat anything with blood in their veins. The Banshee can also choose to kill you for summoning it or if your reason is worthy (if they even decide to listen) or you have enough power to summon her she can choose to aid you. Some Banshee's are evil, some are not. It really all depends on who she was in her previous life.<br />
<br />
Banshee's can choose weapons, more often than not they have chosen something that reminds them of their loved ones or previous life.<br />

<a name='_b_Blue_Men_of_the_Minch_b_'></a><h2><b>Blue Men of the Minch</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Water goblins<br />
<br />
Life Span: 30-40 years<br />
<br />
Region: Underwater caves surrounding the Forgotten Isles and in some places in the deep ocean and in the Lacanta Isles.<br />
<br />
Description: Known to some as water-goblins, and to others as the Little Blue Pixies the Blue Men of the Minch are about a foot tall, have long fingers and claw-like nails, thin, pointed noses and a shock of electric blue hair. Their skin is a fluorescent blue and green actually, but their blue hair and blue orbs for eyes is what gives them their name. They are sinewy, have webbed feet and hands and wear little beyond leafy loin coverings and sometimes a seaweed woven hat. They are very speedy in the water, fast swimmers.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Mischievous, sometimes malicious and tricky these little folk are notorious for wrecking passing ships. They use weeds to lock the ships rudder and run it aground on rocks, as well as punching holes in the hull and causing it to sink. The only way to save the ship is for the captain to talk to them in rhyme and get the last word. They are ruled by a chieftain who loves to pillage gold and treasure from the ships they sink.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Deep chasms and caves are their home, they breath underwater and cannot be on the surface for too long before they die. The grand cave of any chieftain will have chests full of gold and eerie globes of lights so he can see it glitter and gleam.<br />
<br />
Breeding: The Blue Men of the Minch do have womenfolk but they are kept in holes in the sea bed where they raise the Minch Children. The Blue men mate as all pixies and goblins do and they have live births underwater. A Minchling is normally about an inch long when it is born.<br />
<br />
Diet: The Blue Folk are herbivores and eat only the sea plants of the area of ocean they live in. This varies from region to region.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Neither. Although they do actively seek to sink ships so they could be considered a predators when in great numbers, which they often are. It is very unusual to come across a singular Minchmen.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: For some sailors they are the scourge of the seas.<br />

<a name='_b_Brownie_b_'></a><h2><b>Brownie</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Hob-goblin<br />
<br />
Life Span: 50-60 years<br />
<br />
Region: Found in the Lowlands of Fenlar and in the north and east of the country, but some have been found on the Eastern Continent as well.<br />
<br />
Description: They are hairy, rough, very short (about one and a half feet tall), scruffy, and almost always male. Many have only nostrils, no noses. Brownies have the ability to turn invisible, but only when they are very calm and happy. When they are mad they turn a crimson red and go berserk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Temperamental, and sneaky but mostly quite friendly. Brownies can use their powers to steal the essence of food and leave only the image of a meal. They come into hume houses where they sometimes help around the house at night (although helping is not always the way the hume proprietor sees it when they use sugar to clean the stables). These hob-goblins hate being watched while they work and are very picky. Never criticize a brownies work or they will tie your hair to the head board and pluck your nails from your fingers.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Burrows and the base of tree trunks. Sometimes they will live in attics or barns as well.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Brownies have very few females so they keep them out of site and use them only for breeding. The men do the work and clean hume houses at night while the females bare little brownie babes.<br />
<br />
Diet: Anything sweet. Honey bread is their favourite.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Neither.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: They are basically harmless. Even when berserking they might scratch and bite but they won't kill.<br />

<a name='_b_Dryad_b_'></a><h2><b>Dryad</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Wood Nymph<br />
<br />
Life Span: around 100 years<br />
<br />
Region: In any secluded wood or forest and sometimes even jungles.<br />
<br />
Description: Also known as a tree nymph or tree spirit, these creatures are closely tied with trees and with Titan. Their life force is linked to a particular tree which they guard and care for, and their spirit is sealed within it. They have a humanoid form, that of a beautiful maiden with vines for her hair and leaves for her clothes, her skin is the colour of the bark of her spirit tree. In autumn her hair is golden and red and brown, in spring it is green and vibrant. Always female, and all have green eyes with gold and brown flecks around the iris.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: They can be playful or helpful, depending on their mood. Although the favour willow trees. Normally considered to be very shy creatures, except around Elves who are known to be friends to most nymphs. They sometimes fall in love with passing travellers and have been known to follow them for miles and miles. They lust after humes and in the spring often take lovers.. It is sometimes in these trances that they lose themselves and wander too far from the spirit tree. They are offended by those who mistreat nature and will seal the perpetrators in the hollow of a tree if they get the opportunity.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They live in forests and sleep in the boughs of trees and entwine themselves in the roots. The canopy is their roof, the forest their home.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They mate with humes and elves and always give birth to dryad female babes.<br />
<br />
Diet: They eat the fruits of the forest, shrooms and berries and drink from the rivers and streams that run through the woodlands.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Neither, unless you count hunting hume males to breed with.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Safe as long as you do not harm their spirit tree.<br />

<a name='_b_Faeries_b_'></a><h2><b>Faeries</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Winged Nymphs<br />
<br />
Life Span: 150- 200 years<br />
<br />
Region: Found in only the most ancient of Forests (Tirilian in Eramor is believed to be the birth place of the Faeries. Here they commune with the Forest Oracle in her Hollow).<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
<span class="img"><img alt="" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y126/phoenixbyrd/show_image-5.jpg" border="0"  /></span><br />
<br />
This bestiary art is by Az'Astarte. Check out her dA gallery: <a class="wiki"  href="http://swinsea.deviantart.com/">http://swinsea.deviantart.com/</a> And her website: <a class="wiki"  href="http://www.swinsea.com/">http://www.swinsea.com/</a><br />
<br />
Faeries are three inches tall, when adult, are tiny humanoid creatures, with hands and feet and heads in proportion with humes but much much smaller. A Faery normally takes upon them the colour of the flower they came from, having corresponding hair and coloured wings (which are similar to those of butterflies and twice the size of a faeries body, their wingspan twice their height) and emitting a glow of the same colour as well.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Mischievous, playful at times, but also occasionally malicious. They enchant whatever forest they dwell in. Anyone who enters that wood are immediately lost and bewitched by the faeries. Some people are never seen again.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They prefer the most ancient of forests and places where only they dwell. In Tirilian they have the Faery Ring, where they gather on the solstice and equinox to pay homage to Titan and celebrate the seasons.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They magically appear from the pods of flowers throughout all seasons of the year. Different breeds of flowers produce different types of faery.<br />
<br />
Diet: Honey and berries in the summer, tree sap in the winter.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: They use faery dust as a defence mechanism which enchants creatures to their will and sometimes causes them to fall into a deep and sometimes eternal slumber.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Depends on their mood.<br />

<a name='_b_Feermar_b_'></a><h2><b>Feermar</b></h2>
<br />
<b>CREATED BY SHADOWHOUND</b><br />
<br />
Type: Mammal<br />
<br />
Life Span: 35-45 years although they can live to almost 60 in captivity if their health is maintained<br />
<br />
Region: Spread across much of Avalon<br />
<br />
Description: A younger Feermar, half grown<br />
<br />
<span class="img"><img alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/bmmanimalsrock/SOU7BT0aW8I/AAAAAAAAAFA/3IBqcRbpPwg/s512/Snapshot_20081002.jpg" border="0"  /></span><br />
<br />
To the unwary, distant or unknowing eye, these creatures are, to all appearances, horses. And absolutely nothing more. They have a similar structure with four legs, hooves, mane, tail, elongated muzzle and everything else. The differences are far harder to spot, although to someone familiar with them, and once pointed out, they should be fairly noticeable. The biggest difference is their teeth, which are sharp and belong in the mouth of a predator, with the upper canines protruding slightly over the lower lip in the stallions. Feermar are stockier than horses and, although just as tall, usually taller, they tend to look much shorter than they really are.<br />
<br />
They have short, sort of square muzzles with a strongly defined shape and thick necks connected to deep chests that testify to their superior strength. Wide eyes, large and entirely black without any white are another difference, although not nearly as obvious as the teeth. Feermar coats are generally one solid colouring, though there are the occasional blazes or stars or socks but their manes and tails are always white. Greys are predominant in the herds, but the colours can vary to black, brown or, extremely rarely, white, in which case the mane and tail are black.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Herd animals, it is rare to see one alone if tere aren't others near by. Mares make up the greater percentage of most herds, with approximately eight to every one stallion. The herds have never held more than 40 individuals and there are less than twenty herds all told although the numbers remain stable. Despite their like of company, the adults are aggressive creatures and small fights over food or space are normal, usual occurrences. They do not share food, though they will stand together for warmth or shelter, an they don't help the sick, injured or elderly, so most herd members are healthy and in their prime or getting their. Feermar do not tolerate the presence of any other creature and it doesn't matter if that creature is harmful or not and it is generally quite dangerous to approach them, particularly if there are any young foals in the herd.<br />
<br />
Feermar don't keep territories and herds do mix when they meet up, although the fighting is fiercer among rival groups they do settle down eventually and never attack each other without reason or provocation. Nor are the herds fixed, members can come and go as they like, migrating from one group to another without consequences. Unless, of course, there are too many in the one herd already. This prevents inbreeding and they will, in smaller herds, travel quite far to find other herds to join.<br />
<br />
The aggressiveness is a hereditary trait that likely won't ever disappear from the feermar, although if one were to be captured before they were a year old, the younger the better, it could be channelled towards other things. And, since sons/daughters never fight their mothers, doesn't matter how old they are, if a rider raises the foal then they make extremely reliable and very powerful warhorses. They never breed in captivity though, so those sorts of mounts are rare and not always appreciated since they do eat other horses on occasion and tend to frighten other mounts. Strangely enough, however, the stallions become quite tractable when they hear music or are sung to. It doesn't always work and they will grow immune to the effect if it's used too often, but it can calm them completely and almost put them into a trance. Mares, however, generally become furious and could easily go temporarily insane, particularly in the presence of stallions. Perhaps because they believe the music is stealing their mates.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They prefer plains or sparsely wooded areas. Mostly flat land as that produces the most food and it is far easier to catch prey that way.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Feermar mares normally breed every six years or so. The males will simply mate with whoever's in heat at the time and they do fight for the privilege, although even high ranking among the males doesn't guarantee that the mare won't turn them down. They are fiercely protective of their young, which are usually born around spring and grow quickly over the first few months, though it takes two years for them to reach their full size and they reach sexual maturity at seven or eight years of age. Mares only ever have one foal and if it survives the first few days, its chances of survival are highm but there are still risks of accidental death or injury if the mothers don't keep a constant guard of their offspring, particular when two herds meet and the older foals are looking for something smaller to bully.<br />
<br />
Diet: Mostly, they eat grasses, small shrubs or young shoots and meat, any type just so long as it's fresh. Their diet should consist of roughly half and half, along with some water, of course, and whatever minerals they can obtain.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: They are predators, though some other, brave carnivores do look on them as prey. Mostly, they simply keep to their numbers and chase anything dangerous away. If they happen to kill what they're chasing away in the process, then they'll eat it. Feermar tend to hunt in smaller groups of four or five, shepherding their selected prey towards the rest of their herd, where it is generally torn very quickly to pieces. They challenge each other for the meat and cooperate only enough to see it dead. It is a fearful sight to see them arguing over the carcass as they aren't picky about being clean. Mares always get first dibs, usually simply by virtue of being scrappier than the stallions and greater in number.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Dangerous and unapproachable in the wild unless you know exactly what you are doing. They can kill and have been known to attack wanderers who stray too close. They will eat those they kill, but as a general rule, don't normally go after humans and other such races.<br />

<a name='_b_Fire_Serpents_b_'></a><h2><b>Fire Serpents</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Reptile<br />
<br />
Region: Volcanoes<br />
<br />
Life Span: 500 years<br />
<br />
Description: These are dragon-like creatures swathed in fire and made of scales and flesh that can withstand the most extreme heat. They are able morph into a more solid, lizard body and have four legs like that of any reptile, reach the length of three horses (from nose to tail tip) but unlike dragons they do not have wings. Pyra could not create a membrane strong enough to withstand heat and support flight. They have barely any intelligence, and are a very primal and bastardised version of dragons - Pyra's failed attempt at Tempests Dragons.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Bestial is the best way to describe them. They have no formal speech, they cannot commune with other races as many of the higher dragons can, and they are feral. They breath fire using the gases in their stomachs and igniting it with their teeth, scraping their jaws together to create a spark. They are always full of rage, the heat of their habitat causing their brains and bodies to overheat and making them restless.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They need the heat of the volcano and cannot survive for long away from it. Extreme cold kills them instantly so they are not found near newly made volcanoes on the southern ice shelf. They live for the most part in the tunnels made by centuries of eruptions and crawl through these tunnels like worms. They have in the past been called Fire Wyms or Pyra's Dragons.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They mate as most reptiles do and lay eggs as close to the lava pit as possible. The eggs cannot survive the lava but need the heat to hatch and the fumes when they break their shell and join the world.<br />
<br />
Diet: As they burn a lot of energy because of the heat they need a lot of protein. This they get from meat and from the fire rocks on the volcanoes. They need to eat regular to maintain their speedy metabolism.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Predator. They need meat and will eat anything that had a good amount of flesh, including humanoid races and even dragons.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Extremely deadly.<br />

<a name='_b_Giants_b_'></a><h2><b>Giants</b></h2>
<br />
Type: Mammal<br />
<br />
Life Span: 100 years<br />
<br />
Region: Mountain Giants stick to the Mountain Ranges, they have clans in Umikabi and in the Gallian Mountain Range in Avalon. The Ice Giants have clans all over the Southern Ice Shelf and have their own city, Kurn.<br />
<br />
Description: The nature of Giants varies from continent to continent. Mountain Giants are a lot smaller then their Snow Brethren. They are no more then twenty feet tall, the average height being around fifteen feet. They are extremely haiiry, tend to allow their hair to grow past their shoulders and have a green hue to their skin and a rather shaggy look. Their teeth are blunt and tough, being herbivores they tend to eat the rocks of the mountain, and their hands, feet and heads are much larger when compared to that of a hume, taking into account proportions they are disproportionate. Ice Giants are on average thirty feet tall, they have a grey tone to their skin, a tough skin that is hard to puncture and are born with white hair. They blend into their environment and where apparel that aids this. Similar to their mountain cousins they have huge heads, hands and feet.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: The Snow/Ice Giants helped build the Ice Wall but are xenophobic and quite unfriendly to strangers. Whereas the Giants of the mountains in Avalon have been known to be very friendly and hate war. There are of course anomalies and those who break the mould of their culture. However, if a mountain giant tries to join a war of humes and fight for one side or the other the other members of its clan will try and stop it.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Mountain Giants stick to mountain ranges and are rarely seen by humes. Ice Giants are nomads for the most part but congregate in their City in times of need and war.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They have live births and have a twenty four month pregnancy and give birth to five foot babies. Giantess are not particularly maternal and the babe is often left to fend for itself. They believe in the survival of the fittest. Giant numbers have decreased amongst the mountain giants but almost doubled amongst the ice giants. There is no known reason for this.<br />
<br />
Diet: Mountain giants eat rock, ice giants hunt the beasts of the ice continent. Giants surprisingly do not need a lot of sustenance on a regular basis and they tend to distribute the nutrients over a long period of time. Their bodies are often in a state of hibernation, sleeping for long hours during the day and for weeks in the winter. Ice giants eat more as its always winter for them and are far more active then mountain giants as they need to keep warm.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Ice Giants are predators.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Both types of giants can be deadly, purely because of their size. Ice Giants are more dangerous because they are also quite bad tempered creatures and dislike humes and ice elves.<br />

<br />
Half human and half goat, the beautiful females triy to hide their goat half under a green robe, whilst the males are more feral and hunters. Similar in appearance to a Centaur the Glaistig, except they have two legs instead of four. The males have curled horns upon their brow and the females are renowned for their beauty.<br />
<br />
<a class="wiki"  href="b">b</a>Behaviour: The females have a powerful enchantment that invite men to dance with them so they can then she drink their blood. Their is nothing vampiric in this it is rather the females belief that they are close to being hume and if they drink hume blood at the full moon then one day they will transform into a full hume. They dislike breeding with the male Glaistig and the males are jealous of the male humes for drawing their females eyes and desire. For this reason they tend to hunt humes and kill those who stray to close to their clan lands.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They live in the caves high in the mountains, the females preferring secluded groves in the foothills and fountains where they can stare at their beautiful faces and ignore their lower goat legs.<br />
<br />
Breeding: The females are often reluctant to breed so their are few young Glaistig. They have live births and the females often slaughter their young because they are disgusted by them and disappointed. The babes remind them of how far they are from true humanity. Male Glaistig will ravish the females to force them to reproduce.<br />
<br />
Diet: Omnivores. They hunt wild animals such as rabbits and deer and eat a balanced diet including vegetation.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Neither. They will defend themselves, the females using their enchantments and the males their ruddy spears if they deem themselves in danger.<br />

Region: Their main city is north of Tragorian in Eramor, but goblinkind can be found in mountains and in underground caverns and tunnel systems all over the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
Description: They tend to be small, hideous, and avoid sunlight. Sometimes they are dressed in crude leather armour and carry with them primitive weapons such as spears. However they posses great strength and generally reside underground or in other uninhabited areas. Usually stupid creatures, their leaders are most often quite intelligent. The Goblin City in Eramor is the hub of their domain. Their cities are linked via underground tunnels that cover all of the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Goblins are evil and malicious creatures who love to frighten and hurt humans and have a particular hatred for dwarves, but elves evoke hate in them too. They patrol the surface in gangs.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Subterranean, dirty holes, tunnels and caverns. They have the odd village or town above ground but do not like to live under the sun. These hovels are ruddy wooden constructs that rarely survive the winter unless they are close to a goblin city.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They breed like rats and have live births.<br />
<br />
Diet: Omnivores they eat raw meat when they can get it, and the black shrooms of the underground caverns and slime when they can't.<br />

Life Span: 100 years<br />
<br />
Region: The forests of the world.<br />
<br />
Description: These creatures are a little more harmful than their &quot;cousin&quot; the Dryad. Looking like foliage, these creatures can easily disguise themselves from humans, whom they loathe. At night they are bound to the tops of their tree/home and can't leave because touching the earth at night will cause them to vanish forever.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: They hibernate in winter, but are malicious to travellers the rest of the year. Some call them 'living trees' and if a hume crosses their path or harms their wood then they will kill them. elves and ech'Lun have some talent in speaking to these creatures but when they are in ire it is impossible to reason with them and they will not distinguish between hume or elf.<br />
<br />
Habitat: The deep woods, ancient forests.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Their breeding patterns are unknown but their young appear to 'grow' as trees do.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
A harpy is a truly interesting sight. With the head (and torso some sources claim) of a woman, and body of a vulture, these creatures are incredibly filthy. There are three mother harpies, Aello, Celaeno, and Ocypete. Aello is Queen of the Harpies, and their children are vulture like creatures called Boreads (who are smaller versions of their mother Harpies). Harpies are huge creatures, fifteen feet high, twenty wide and with a wing span of thirty feet. Aello has raven black hair, Ocypete red hair and Celaeno green hair.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Not a race of Darkness, yet they have defected and now dedicated themselves to it and serve it. Aello is a Thyrza. Boreads are somewhat feral, but the Harpies are very intelligent and eloquant, using logic and wit to convince creatures to serve them. Aello is far more active and often leaves the island to fulfil her role as a Thyrza.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They live in their aeries on their secluded island in the north of the nether realm. The island is shrouded with mist and ships are often wrecked on its shores if they get too close.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They live and breed on the island of Kelandra. The Harpies breed with the male Boreads and eat them after they have mated.<br />
<br />
Diet: They prefer man flesh and Harpies and Boreads alike will fly into the seas in search of ships and sailors. Some they bring back to their island and torture, others they eat in stages .<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Predator. They hunt sailors and crave man flesh.<br />

Region: All over the Nether Realm<br />
<br />
Description: Shape-shifters that can shift into the form of various birds, these creatures have been known to gather in groups to hunt. No human has ever been reported to have been physically harmed by them intentionally however, humes that have killed a Hyters and cooked and eaten its flesh have been poisoned. They can shift into any bird, regardless of size (except the Roc, they cannot take the form of a Roc for some reason).<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Attracted to humes and hume activity they can be a bit of a pest, ruining crops and targeting markets and hume gatherings. They peck and buzz around, sometimes mistaken for carrion.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They are most active in late afternoon and early evening. Most Hyters tend to be around humans. Avalon is crawling with them.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They lay eggs and breed as birds do. Their eggs change colour and size.<br />
<br />

<br />
Imps are about five inches tall, when adult, are tiny humanoid creatures, with hands and feet and heads in proportion with humes but much much smaller. An Imp has a light brown hue to their skin and normally have black and silver hair. They are fast but wingless, have needle like fingers and sharp nails and pointed ears. They wear woven apparel, usually in the fashion of whatever land they are born in, they mimic hume clothes and styles and use cotton and silks to make their own tiny clothes.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Like their faery kin they are mischievous, cunning and untrustworthy. They have a lot more contact with other races and are no where near as shy as faery. They steal and act as spies quite often and sell their knowledge for gold, even though they can rarely spend it, they horde it. They also have a penchant for silver thimbles.<br />
<br />
Habitat: Hume households.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Unlike faeries Imps actually breed, albeit not very often. They are too selfish to want to share their lives and houses with another imp. Quite a solitary creature, making them quite rare indeed.<br />
<br />
Diet: They adore biscuits and nuts and cherries.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Mice hunt them, but Imps often tame them and use them as mounts. They despise Rats though.<br />

<a name='_b_Kinta_b_'></a><h2><b>Kinta</b></h2>
<br />
<b>CREATED BY SHADOWHOUND</b><br />
<br />
Type: Mammal<br />
<br />
Life Span: 20-25 years<br />
<br />
Region: Southern Ice Shelf in the wild, but domesticated ones might be found anywhere where the climate is relatively cool<br />
<br />
Description: Small creatures, they are slightly smaller than medium sized dogs, but the size can range from kinta to kinta. They all have six limbs; short, broad wings at their shoulders, forelegs that are a bit too short to walk with that end in hand-like paws and powerful hindlegs with giant paws at the end and rough pads that give them necessary purchase on the ice. Their claws are retractable. Each kinta is covered in thick, fluffy fur almost two inches long that shortens on their face and muzzle so it doesn't obstruct their view. The colours of their fur do vary and aren't always white, though they are never black or bright, just pastel and pale. Like lavender or blue or grey. Nothing that will show up against the snow.<br />
<br />
Their tails are thick and just long enough to offer some form of balance without compromising too much body heat. It end in a heavy tuft, that adds approximately four inches to it. They are very flexible creatures, with short necks that can bend almost completely in any direction, back, forward and even to the side. Kinta's have round heads and short muzzles filled with needle sharp, tiny teeth. They do have ears, but they are short enough that only the very tips of them can be seen beyond the fur. The one thing that marks these creatures out from the ordinary, apart from their living on the ice continent, is their eyes. Kintas have large, round eyes that can change colour depending on their mood and from which they can summon a glow as bright and steady as a lamp.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Gentle creatures, kintas enjoy company, although too many of them mean not enough food, so they do compete and hold their own territories, but they are far more lax about keeping others out and often live in pairs. They are adaptable to change and are extremely inquisitive, very little can keep them from investigating something that has caught their interest as their fore paws are dexterous and the shortened fingers incredibly strong. They enjoy new opportunities and are intelligent enough to learn from their experience but those smarts only go so far and they have the stubborness of a young child and the same sort of attention span. They are remarkable scavengers and will eat anything and everything of what they find, they are capable of digesting anything and, so long as they are healthy, are unlikely to get sick from what they eat.<br />
<br />
They can be domesticated, and will quite readily follow whatever master has the patience to train them and teach them how to live in the civilised world. Unfortunately, teaching one how to get its own food, can sometimes lead to it showing the wild ones the same maneouver. They won't run away from wherever their home is, but they will wander. Good alarms, they can be taught friend or foe and have an annoying screechy wail that no one could possibly sleep through.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They live in snowy environments mostly, as they use the snow to dig out dens, but rocky or icey environs aren't a deterrant just so long as the place isn't a desert they should be able to adapt themselves eventually. it isn't uncommon for them to be found in or around the cities as they are a source of easier food and they aren't at all adverse to begging or befriending the natives in each city for that food, or a place of warmth should heavy storms come up suddenly.<br />
<br />
Breeding: Kintas do mate for life, and each takes a hand in raising their pups. They have live young that are born fully developed, with fur and eyes that just need to open, and one parent is always with them to make sure they stay warm enough and don't get into any trouble. Usually a litter consists of one to two pups, three being unusual and four being almost unheard of. But the environment usually doesn't allow a survival rate of more than two past a year anyway. The females reach breeding age at six and the males at four, litters take three years to raise, mostly because they aren't as severe in sending their offspring away as most would be.<br />
<br />
Diet: They eat mostly things that are smaller than themselves, or scavenge. Truly, anything edible will do.<br />
<br />
Predator or Prey: Opportunist - what they find, they eat, if they have to catch it, they will generally use whatever technique works. Sometimes they will hunt together, flushing prey towards their partner, but usually it is small enough to catch and kill on their own. If there is enough, they will share, if there isn't, they eat it themselves.<br />
<br />
Deadly or Safe: Being small and quiet creatures, they aren't likely to attack. They are capable of defending themselves, but they probably won't cause any fatal wounds.<br />

Description: A snake like creature that is made of molten rock and is at most thirty feet long and five feet wide. The segments are black at the most dense and glowing red at the joints. The head is serpentine and a tongue of fire often lashes out, at this is how it sees. It has no eyes and is blind, as eyes cannot withstand the lava.

Life Span: around 100 years<br />
<br />
Description: Water Nymphs are humanoid creatures with hands, feet and bodies of humes, but a sheer blue glint to their glazed skin. They do not have scales but they do have pupils black eyes and always have long hair with a mixture of greens and blues woven through them. They braid their hair, both male and female, and have markings on their backs that they are all born with. Slightly shorter then the average hume, standing on average at around 5 feet, they are slender and enchanting creatures. Their voices are melodic and echo and their apparel is similar to their dryad cousins in the way that they use their natural habitat to cover themselves, using seaweed and vines to cover their nakedness. They can breath underwater and above using their gills and lungs.<br />
<br />
Behaviour: Friendly, amiable, intelligent and sociable. These creatures are friends to the Azail and often their servants in the out posts of the Azaili Empire.<br />
<br />
Habitat: They have villages on the sea bed, and live near the Azail but they do not mind dwelling on the Outposts either.<br />
<br />
Breeding: They reproduce in a similar way to humes but their pregnancies last for twelve months and they are only fertile once every five years. They know when they are ready to be fertilised and seek the calm rifts of the ocean and peaceful caverns to mate.<br />
<br />
Diet: they have a diet of fish and sea vegetation.<br />

These human-size creatures are incredibly stupid, dull creatures who do not often utilise their strength or their huge ears (which should give them excellent hearing but orges are too inattentive to notice anything beyond their own limited area.). On average about six feet tall, hunched backs making them seem more like five and a half feet, orges are very ugly, have trunk like legs and huge bellies. They wear loincloths made of hume skin and have a penchant for helms, even though they wear no other armour and only use wooden clubs. Orgress are smaller then the males and often more ferocious and savage.<br />

<br />

<br />
