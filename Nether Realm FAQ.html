<br />
A- The Character Creation Centre's Profile Application Forum is where you need to submit your profile application and it is also where you will find the character sheets. I suggest you look at the profiles that have already been accepted to gauge what we are looking for here.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q- Where do I start?</div><br />
<br />
A - This wiki, and reading up on the world. Look at the Main Character Profile Sheet<a href="" title="Create page: Main+Character+Profile+Sheet"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and make your character. Also, make sure you read the rules.<br />
<br />

<div class="simplebox">Q - May I be a Race or class that isn't on the lists in the Library?</div><br />
<br />
A - We are currently only accepting races from established members. I must warn you though, I am very harsh with accepting Races, so make sure they fit the world, or you will be doing a lot of editing. The main sticking points are the Primal Powers, so please please please learn about the magic of this world and where it comes from. :D<br />

<div class="simplebox">Q - What is an NPC?</div><br />
<br />
A - An NPC is a NON PLAYING CHARACTER; meaning characters in an RP that are random people played by no one and everyone. The barman, the waitress, the servant, the wagon driver, the farmer. These are often NPCed by everyone, unless stated in an OOC topic or post. Listed NPC character accounts are used to NPC at the players discretion. For instance, someone needs a random vampire to attack them, I log into my NPC BYRD NPC account and post for them. Simple really.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q - How do battles work?</div><br />
<br />
A - The same way normal RPing does. You just post your actions and reactions. Unless you have permission from the people you are RPing with DO NOT move their character and only write what your characters actions are. If you stab at them let them decide if they want the blow to land and harm them.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q -How do I RP?</div><br />
<br />
A- The Nether Realm is a high Fantasy Play by Post RPG Board. It is text based RPing, there are no stats, battling, or trading here, we are all about the plots and stories. Everyone has their own style, some use free form RPing, some are more structured. If you are totally new to this style of writing I suggest looking in the RP Area - Regions of the Nether Realm and reading the RP's people have posted. It's the best way to learn really. We are fine with teaching people but you must be of a certain standard, i.e, having good grammar (not perfect, obviously, but we would ask you punctuate, capitalise and use spell check) and being a creative person, preferably a writer with a love for high fantasy.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q- What is OOC and IC?</div><br />
<br />
A- OOC means Out Of Character, and IC means In Character. You can only post in your character accounts in the IC Forums. Post outside of them and you will be disciplined. Out of Character basically means anything where you are posting as yourself. My main account is phoenixbyrd, I am Claire, the owner of this board. This is my OOC account. ;)<br />
<br />

<div class="simplebox">Q- What are the rules of this world?</div><br />
<br />
A- As it is an original world not all the races are going to be familiar, so do your homework. A link to the rules is at the forums and at the website.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q- Do I have to create a separate account for my character/s?</div><br />
<br />
A- Yes, yes you do. Its too confusing having one account that you use to RP several characters. If you are confused about making accounts or are new to Invision you can post as a guest in the help forum, or in the chatbox or chatroom and we will strive to assist you.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q-How do I create a character?</div><br />
<br />
A- Go to the Character Creation Centre at the NR forum to post your profiles. Feel free to post a help topic there if you need help with your application, or contact a mod or admin.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<div class="simplebox">Q- Can my characters be in more then one RP at the same time?</div><br />
<br />
A- Technically, they can, but you have to make it clear when they are where they are. If I have more then one character in more then one RP at the same time I post a link in the first post of an RP saying what RP they came from, or that this is before such and such RP.<br />
<br />
It can get too complicated though, so my advice is to stick to one RP at a time<br />
