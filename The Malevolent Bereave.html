The Malevolent Bereave’s traditional banner is a mauve poppy with a black center on a scarlet field. However since Vahirga’s risen to Matriarch they have gotten into the habit of flying her house banner, silver on green with a black snake wound upon a sword.<br />
<br />
The Malevolent Bereave is not only a Matriarchic Clan, but has quickly become widely known as a warrior’s clan with an affinity for duel wielding and is best known for their form fitting ademion chain mail armour. Their textiles are so well crafted and fitted; their armour can be worn over the carefully designed clothing. The highest ranking officials are hardly ever seen outside their armour and nearly everyone wears weapons. The armour still sports the poppy even if their banners don’t. All the highest ranking officials are all female as it is hard to gain any rank at all as a male.<br />
<br />
While all the Bereave’s soldiers are heavily trained in discipline, the Ashen Guard stands out above the rest. Even as they march stoically along side their Matriarch without so much as moving their icy gaze toward the throng of people who have no doubt gathered to witness their arrival, they have a way of making even the most confident person cower. To say they are the ‘perfect soldier’ would be wrong. They are each as sharp and calculating as their Matriarch and just appear to have the perfect soldier act so well memorized few would suspect more then robotic mechanics in the minds of the Ashen.<br />

<br />
 The Malevolent Bereave is a matriarchic Clan that is more akin to the amazon’s way of life then anything else. In other words: woman rule supreme and the males are nothing but slaves to their whims. While it is true that males of the highest Houses would have power over the females of the lowest Houses, or males of rank would have power over females that don’t, they are still pretty much slaves. Only the very rare male ever makes it to a position of true power within the ranks of the Malevolent Bereaved.<br />
<br />
While the true amazons had a fairly static ruling class, the Bereave’s is constantly changing. The obsidian elf’s chaotic and incurable nature makes for constant scheming against, and destruction of, whoever is in the ruling class at the time. Lower Houses are constantly seeking to destroy and take the place of upper Houses without making themselves vulnerable to being usurped themselves. Powers rise and fall like the waves of the ocean, with names of all the Houses who have passed forgotten.<br />
<br />
While it’s true that each House plots and schemes against each other, it is in fact ‘illegal’ within the clan to do so openly. Everyone of importance must be killed or converted when eliminating a House otherwise it could spell death for the attacking house. While it’s okay to know that one particular House destroyed another through rumour, open knowledge of it would bring down the wrath of all Houses, higher and lower, onto the House that made the initial attack and that House would be destroyed. Even one surviving member of a destroyed House, male or female, with the ability to point his finger could bring ruin to its attacker to exact their revenge. When a House is eliminated in such a fashion it is erased from written memory and never to be discussed out in the open.<br />
<br />
When one house attacks another they must take extreme caution not to get caught. Most do so under the cover of darkness with all troops hiding any indicator of what House they are from. The attacks are swift and deadly, with usually no warning ahead of time. Slaves and soldiers not killed in the attack are usually acquired by the attacking house.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History:</b></h1>
<br />
 Started by a rather large group of female elders who did not want to be ruled by their male kin, most sought to stifle the Malevolent Bereave’s existence before they got established. It proved to be more difficult then the rest of obsidian elf society would imagine. The woman had learned to use the powers of darkness that would leave their enemies feeling alone and confused as they cut at their ranks relentlessly. Every so often they would allow other females to join their ranks or catch and detain males of their enemy for no more then breeding purposes. These males were treated as no more then slaves in the hands of their masters.<br />
<br />
Eventually the rest of the obsidian elf society would learn that the Malevolent Bereave were a force to be reckoned with. They became one of the first well established clans in obsidian elves society. Though the Elders that started the clan were eventually killed off, in battle or in subterfuge, their ideals never did. The Malevolent Bereave still controls their male population with an iron fist and they are very much still a warrior clan.<br />

<br />
 The Malevolent Bereave, as a clan, can use any and all majicks available for their race to learn, including Ether. They are most skilled, as a clan, in majicks of concealment and ambush, as well as a few power attacks. Individuals, of course, choose their favoured areas and specializations.<br />

<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
 The Malevolent Bereave is usually lead by the most powerful House in it’s Clan at the time. Whoever rules the house rules the Bereave, unless an ulterior arrangement has been made otherwise.<br />
<br />
The Bereave’s most powerful elite soldiers usually become part of what is known as the Ashen Guard. The number of Ashen depends on who is in power over the Clan at the time. Some may have hundreds of Ashen, while others limit it to but a handful. Once an obsidian elf becomes an Ashen, they acquire themselves their own Noble status and start their own house within the clan, which is why most prefer to limit their numbers.<br />
<br />
They are not only a warrior clan, but are very militant as well. Each soldier is highly disciplined. The amount of times and capacity in which they step out of line is directly linked to who is in rule. Vahirga, the current matriarch, runs a tight ship but will allow random acts of violence toward a male or slave.<br />
