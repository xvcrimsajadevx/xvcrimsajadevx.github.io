<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
She is a moving statue, moving between rocks and stone, she can appear as a mould from a wall, melting into a humanoid form. Her Djinn grey glowing eyes are the only feature to remain constant. The hue, the size even the solidity of Cephas changes, but never her Djinn eyes.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
Her temples are carved into the mountains and are cavernous. The Mountain elves have made one on each continent in honour of her.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Cephas can mould mountains and move them. She rarely uses these powers, but one notable occassion was when Gallian was destroyed. To heal the land she raised up the Mountains of Gallian to protect the Nexus. Even though Uphaz erected another temple there, she would not destroy it. She abhors the rows of the Djinn and will n ot touch another's affairs, even if they encroach on her own.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
