Member of the order can come in different styles as it is not as rigidly controlled as the rest of Sedana, yet the order is unflinchingly loyal to it leaders.<br />
Some members will wear dark leather jerkins and chaps with a black cloak - these are the more civilised members of the order and they operate around the Aristocratic Province.<br />
However, there are a few far more dangerous members of the order who roam the lands of the Sovereign and these often wear a long black leather trench-coat with a wider-brimmed hat that can mask the features of their face. These member are often heavily armed and can carry magical negaters built by the Schools of Anti-Magic<a href="" title="Create page: Anti-Magic" class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />

Members are often fanatical warriors who are ruthless in their persecution - there are more than a few reports of entire villages put to the sword by the order in previous years jut so that one or two wizards would die.<br />
They are sometimes loud and forceful, sometimes quiet, cunning but always ruthlessly unflinching in their quest to end magic in Sedana.<br />
All members wear a medallion depicting Magnus himself burning a 'Heretic' ( as they came to call the user of magic. )<br />
<br />
<b>History:</b><br />
<br />
When, in 2000E Magic was outlawed the persecutions of user of magic began, it was often difficult to apprehend and execute users of Magic, and with the wars with House Lightbane and Eraosia the loses of men were deemed unacceptable, so for many years it seemed that magicians might be able to sneak into the country and cause mayhem.<br />
2205E after the Schools of Anti-Magic<a href="" title="Create page: Anti-Magic" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> were formed it became alot easier to catch user of magic but the fact that the army was being relied upon to carry out the movements held back attempts to completely eradicate the scourge of magic from the land.<br />
Following the great plague the watchers met and decided that they needed a dedicated force to fight magic to allow their diminished strength to still hold out against their neighbours and one of them decided to set up a secret order of Hunters dedicated to fighting the war against magic - this order was titled The Edanian Order of Arbiters, the choice of title was a look back to the past when the temple Vadok, the deliverer of Judgement, had formed the centrepiece of the Sovereign's glory<br />
For many years the order acted as a law unto itself, publicly burning magic-users and spreading hatred and distrust of magic throughout Sedana. Yet, in an event the members of the order call 'The Great Purges' many members were hunted down and executed by the order of the sovereign for such acts of brutality. The paladins - who have always begrudged the military rank of the order led this attack and only 5 members of the order escaped punishment.<br />
Following this the order rebuilt itself under the leader ship of a man who took the name Magnus - in imitation of the founder of the order and one of the statements he often used when teaching his new men was : ' If the military are the hammer of the Sovereign, smashing all of his enemies. We are the scalpel that incisively removes the tumour of majick from society'<br />
The new order was far more deadly as it adopted very secretive policies, so that only ranking members of the sovereign's army new that it still existed. Most commoners thought it destroyed and now only a memory.<br />
The order used this as their greatest weapon - disbelief in their existance, yet many people had suspicions that the sovereign had men specially trained to fight his wars.<br />
To this day the order remains a powerful - if unseen force in the politics of the realm and members hold considerable dread - even to the highest of nobles as they are instructed to act without prejudice and be as ruthless with the rich as the poor.<br />
