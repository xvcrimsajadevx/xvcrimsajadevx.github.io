<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> They were born in Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> but after some years the emigrated into the Great desert in which they created their greatest city. For centuries they lived on the borders of the continent of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> developing their society, it was until the rebellion that they moved. The old sage Kemuri as he was known created Suna'Kemuri soon after the Suna'arashi established their camps on the great desert.<br />
<br />
It was said that no creature dared to inhabit this place but for them it was more than the perfect spot, it was their promised land. After reaching the place where earth turn into sand they knew that that would be their home, facing some terrible empire the dispute for territory took long and it was harsh but at the end deep into the desert they found their home.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Being a combination a race of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> and humes their ageing process is quite different from normal humes, their life span can go up to 200 years not ageing for most part of their lives but around their 150 years their bodies starts to get older and the ageing effects starts to be noticeable, during this process they are not different form any other elder hume, they became slower, lose strength, sight, hearing, just like a hume.<br />
<br />
When they die their bodies pass through three different stages:<br />
<br />
First they turn as solid as rock, then they transform into sand and finally their bodies decompose into dust leaving only the clothes intact, no matter if it is natural death or caused by external causes the process never change.<br />
<br />
It is said that within the remaining sand, that once formed the body of a Suna'arashi, some part of his or her essence still exist in that sand and so those remains are kept deep within the mayor temple of the city, keeping them safe and unaltered for a secret ritual which will be used when the final war come, there is no more information about this ritual in &quot;the Sand Clock&quot; book for it is believe to be only a legend but it is said that along with others that ritual will help saving the <a title="light" href='light.html' class='wiki'>light</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Religion:</b> As every creation ever made the Suna'arashi worshipped their maker but as time passed by they stopped adoring <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> and started to worship what they believed to be their true creator, saviour and protector: The Sand.<br />
<br />
In Suna'arashi temples The Sand is represented as a beautiful young woman holding a baby in her arms.<br />
Kemuri is also worshipped as a higher being and a statue in his honour was build in the middle of Suna'Kemuri, in the temples sculptures of Kemuri can also be found not in the main room of the temples but in near rooms.<br />
<br />
They consider the book of The Sand Clock as a sacred item and along with they key to the volt in which the bodies of long dead Suna'arashi are kept are these two of the most sacred artefacts in the city.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
At the first steps the Suna'arashi took upon the Nether Realm they looked like creatures made out of mud constantly falling apart, with no distinguishing feature from female or male, with two eyes socket and no eyes, just a void. Small pieces of rock all around their bodies, drops of sand constantly falling as well as rocks; always walking with a hunch for their bodies where unstable. Their legs feet less, just a couple of tubes from their waist down that crawl through the floor. Their mouth always open moaning instead of speaking, Humanoid in appearance.<br />
<br />
But evolution played its part as well as the God the Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. He changed them into faster more useful creatures, making them more solid; but it was useless they where not what he expected so once again he changed them, moulding them and remaking them. Now they where creatures with humanoid for made out of sand, still with no distinguishing feature between each other. Their skin was sand like, of the same colour as well. They where slim and tall, with no fingers but one, the palm of the hand and the thumb.<br />
They had some facial features like a nose and eye sockets but no mouth nor ears and they where hairless. One last time they where changed and their final form was completely humanoid, Now their most common trait their black haired and with black eyes.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
The Suna'arashi are not known for being a war like race yet they are very famous for being extremely powerful in the battle field and cold blooded murderers if they have to engage battle; a distinguishing fact is that they never take prisoners; they always destroy their enemy's. They're not completely war like. Their are factions of their society that could be considered pacifist as they prefer not to battle.<br />
Architects by nature they enjoy using their majick to build, most of their buildings are made almost completely out of hardened sand.<br />
<br />
A very artistic race focused in sculptures, their ability to build is uncanny. It is why their cities are considered to be among the most beautiful in the Nether Realm. They have very strong links with their culture and only very few have rejected those links.<br />

<br />
As Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>'s Elven population grew in number and so it did that of their enemies.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> and the Zekten were natural enemies of the Titan's First and with their dark alliance the <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> where easy prey. Along with the Fading and the constant battles between the residents of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and their nemesis the number of elves where starting at the end of the first millennia to decrease fast.<br />
<br />
Titan had to make a choice: let the very best of his creation become extinct or create a defence so powerful that he could protect them and stop the rivers of blood that flowed from the veins of his beloved.<br />
The legend says that <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> awoke once again from his slumber and rose above the ground to create life one more time, from his gigantic hand reaching into his chest and from his very own heart he took part of his life force to create two new creatures, and he cast them into the shores of the continent to live and protect.<br />
<br />
The new born where made of rock as <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, they where strong and resistant and soon the grew in numbers but they where not cognitive and almost statuesque in nature. Once again Titan intervened and changed their bodies giving them more movement and less power. They still had little intelligence and they could do little to fight, so once again he changed them into a strong, mobile and resistant material: Sand.<br />
<br />
They were good warriors, good protectors but they where not intelligent enough to be anything more then guards, what his First needed were intellectual warriors who could defeat the likes of the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> and their cunning minds. <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> saw his experiment fail time and again but took one final and desperate measure, sacrificing two humes and two of his First to create the very first of the Suna'arashi.<br />
<br />
In the most fierce of storms as the story goes the four souls merged, the male and the female fused with the creatures and thus were born the guardians of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They where strong, fast, resilient, agile and cognitive; far from the others that preceded them. They where not made of sand but of hume flesh, for the unknowing eye they where natural born humes.<br />
<br />
The new children of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> grew and soon expanded through all the shores of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, acting as guardians for the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>. During one attack from their nemesis the strangest of gifts manifested itself. According to the book of &quot;The Sand Clock&quot; in which all the history of the Suna'arashi is written, the very first attack they had to repel was almost overwhelming for these newly born creatures, for their lack of majick and technology but one of them was the first one to ever use their unknown gift.<br />
<br />
The Skirmish seemed lost, they where being annihilated with ease, the night had finally devoured the sun and the moon stood brilliant in the infinite sky, nothing but the sound of waves, metal crashing, screams of desperation could be heard. When the final blow was to be given the first one &quot;stood up&quot; and ran towards the enemy with no hope of survival; he threw his the first punch which would turn out to be the last, and in blind obedience the sand of the beaches upon which they fought lifted from the ground as it if was with life of its own and in a roaring storm banished the enemies of Lenal.<br />
<br />
After that night two things were to be remembered; Firstly - the name of the guardians. This name was created from the sand that won the battle and the storm in which it destroyed their enemies and saved their lives, they where called the &quot;Suna'Arashi&quot;; The leader of the Suna' arashi was finally known has the &quot;Sage kemuri&quot;. <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> watched them from his vista upon the Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and saw their potential and the faith in their hearts. Soon the sand controlling majick manifested in all the Suna'arashi as something natural, along with their new powers as higher class warriors. This was a gift from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> as well as something they had earned. They inhabited the beaches of Lenal. In truth they should never have been beaten for they had their source of power all around them; but things don't always work out the way they should.<br />
<br />
For years peace ruled the land but it was when water poured from the sky in one of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> greatest storms that another battle took place. They fought against the Obsidians elves and the Zekten warriors, but it was a grey day in which water was against them; their existence almost came to an end. Wet sand is impossible to control for a warrior of the Suna'arashi breed and this weakness was not to be left aside by their enemies. During the battle rain poured and the nemesis armies advanced, thousands of Suna'arashi perished in this battle for they could do nothing against the water and the brutal attack force of the Zekten battalion and the majick power of the Obsidian elves. The small battle lasted for only two days but more than half of the guardians died. The elves were overwhelmed by the numbers of their enemies and could do nothing more then wait, fight and hope. <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> temples where filled with gifts, and prayers.<br />
<br />
The massacre continued until Kemuri, using his life force and consuming much of his powers used the still wet sand to fight until he had no choice but to surrender; being close to death he had given all he could to win the battle but nothing could be done. This power Kemuri used did not last for long and could only use low level majicks and only hold the Dark Army at bay. <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> knew he could not directly intervene so he summoned his powers one more time and Kemuri received the gift of elven immortality so he could use his gift and save Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> from destruction. By making the Suna'arashi immortal Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> could be protected forever. The army was not completely destroyed, but Kemuri did slow it down long enough for the other Suna'arashi to gather and with rocks, sticks and blood; they fought until the end.<br />
<br />
The were doomed to lose even with the power of Kemuri on their side for they where outnumbered, but suddenly the sunrise came. In a matter of moments Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> was covered by the light and the sand was once again dry. How the battle ended was never recorded in the book of &quot;the Sand Clock&quot; but it was said that with nothing but the their will the Suna'arashi held back the army until a strange light vanished the forces of <a title="darkness" href='darkness.html' class='wiki'>darkness</a> without leaving any trace. After this battle the Suna'arashi race was almost extinct; only a few hundred had survived that day; seeing his guardians so physically weak <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> gave them one final gift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let those who where born from the sand receive her protection, Let all who is born under Suna'arashi blood be untouchable&quot;, with those words <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> gave the guardians the sand protection.<br />
<br />
Years passed and still was the air of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Her glorious sunrises and sunsets, fantastic nights, made it a paradise for <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> and nothing more. There were now only the occasional attacks on the outer reaches of Elvenhome for the Guardians to deal with, and even then the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> took up arms themselves and fought off their enemies. It was this discarding of the race that had saved them from complete destruction that triggered the revolution; the fact that the <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> considered their guardians as a lesser race. Never welcome to enter the inner circles of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> or elven society, they were regarded as &quot;impure&quot; in the eyes of <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a>.<br />
<br />
Tired of being disrespected and treated like cattle Kemuri did the unthinkable, ad committed sacrilege.<br />
<br />
He entered the depths of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and without permission he entered into the most holy place in Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, The Rock of Ages.<br />
<br />
An impure creature setting foot upon holy ground was an action rarely forgiven but this was not the case, as the legend says Kemuri stood still in front of Titans<a href="" title="Create page: Titans"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> face and demanded to be equals to the <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a>. His life was spared because he was such a great warrior, but <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> never answered his prayer. They had received all the gifts they had a right to, and he would grant them no more. The Suna'arashi grew tired of serving the elves as slaves and protectors, and so they rebelled.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the day, while the sun burned the land with his light the Suna advanced deeper and deeper into the continent until they reached Titan's slumber place, they all prayed for hours until they where discovered by the elven priests. Considering them rebels and traitors for defying their rules the elves gathered, each alamia adding to its ranks making an army that attacked the Suna. In desperation and out of fear that they might kill the elves the guardians fled towards their home upon the shores and they where they believed they were safe.<br />
<br />
They deliberated long about what they should do now, whether they should flee Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> or demand of the Elves that they be deemed their equals. They were not going to go against their purpose in life and spill the blood of the First, so they took the peaceful path and decided to flee Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. This they did with no further hesitation. Battle was not in their nature but in their lives, after days of buildings boats out of any material they could find they where stopped by <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> himself who did not accept this act of rebellion. <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> ordered the <a title="elves" href='elves.html' class='wiki'>elves</a> to stop the Suna'arashi from fleeing.<br />
<br />
The battle was never recorded by neither elf or Suna'arashi scribe. It was a dark day, and one both races wanted to forget. It is told by the only Suna'arashi alive, Kemuri; as he saw and lived the battle in his own flesh. He had seen all the battles of his people, and only he knew what it all meant. When the battle ended, with the Suna'arashi driven from Elvenhome, legend says that they levitated the sand of the beaches for ten days and nights until they hovered over the Great Desert. Here they founded their new home, and mixed the sand of Lenal with that of the Great Desert of the Eastern Continent.<br />
<br />
After weeks of wandering in the desert the found some natives which to their surprise resembled dragons but wingless, those creatures attacked them but there was little they could do against the overwhelming defence and attack the suna'arashi had. Later they would find out who those attackers were, but no good relation came after that first encounter. Blood had been split and enmities formed between the Suna and the Thossak. Battle after battle reigned; it was the only way the Suna'arashi knew now, and even though war wasn't on their blood it was in their life, it was their life and it became part of their society.<br />
<br />
Deep in the desert the great city of Suna'Kemuri was created, first the wall of gaiheki, a wall so high that it could block the sun itself and so thick that would stop the rampaging fist of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, according to the folklore legends told by Suna'Kemuri; then it came the city, a city created in dreams and built in reality. At first the city was just a mountain of sand but it didn't take long for the Suna'arashi to apply their artistic talents. They had great architects and artisans amongst them, and the city came to be known by all races as the &quot;city of the sandman&quot;. Its sight was so beautiful that it seemed taken out of a dream. Filled with green spaces, trees of the earth and grasses of the plains grew here! Fountains, roads, temples, palaces, markets, houses, statues, artificial lakes that where created after digging into the ground, it was and it is an oasis, a promised land, the Haven of the Suna.<br />

</div><a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
--Being made of sand and being transmuted into flesh their bodies maintained the ability to move the sand from which they were made of. No longer actually made of sand the ability to control it remained.<br />
<br />
--Their majick its mainly based on using sand but along with some other spells they have improved their own abilities.<br />
<br />
--For example; the use of sand to heal themselves. Only Suna can heal Suna. They cannot heal any other race or be healed by any other race.<br />
<br />
--Also their bodies have been blessed by Titan so that sand will automatically protect them from any danger even without their knowing or at their command. It is an innate and automatic defence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Added_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Added Information</b></h1>
<br />
--Only Kemuri is able to control wet sand as he is an Ancient of this Race. The only Ancient that survives. Kemuri is also the only immortal in the whole Suna'arashi kingdom as that power was taken from them when they left Elvenhome. The gift was removed by <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> the moment they deserted their calling of Guarding the First. It is rare for a Suna'arashi to use a weapon, only when their sand is wet and even so its a rare event.<br />
<br />
--It is said that the sand moves, when protecting, as fast as the blink of an eye; this defence has it drawbacks, as nothing its perfect. Even when the sand protects them even without their will its a form of majick and so majick energy is used (and they weaken if it is a prolonged use of majick). Whenever a Suna'arashi uses the sand majicks willingly the same principle applies.<br />
<br />
--Legends say that they could fight for days without resting, but this is merely legend. All Suna must rest once their energy is depleted or they will die.<br />
<br />
--Some Suna'arashi learn how to make glass by moving faster and faster the small pieces of sand heating it up until they turn into glass; usually they mix the sand with different elements so they can add some colour to it and thus making coloured glass. This is a skill of their artisans.<br />
<br />
--On their forehead at the moment of their birth they receive a mark to identify them Suna'arashi, and not humes or elves. On the right side of there body if they are female and on the left side if they are male. They are marked with the word &quot;Suna&quot; written in one of their ancient symbols.<br />
<br />
--They need little water to survive and the same goes with food, so the desert serves them well as a home; but in spite of this they still harvest, raise farm animals and fish (the Suna that live on the edges of the great desert and even have ports and maintain part of the trade route.)<br />
<br />
--Heat harms them very little, they barely perspire.<br />
<br />
--They have developed mining in the great canyons of the south and thanks to their powers and they gather minerals that help them build amazing artefacts. Also thanks to mining they where able to find inner lakes and rivers hidden in the desert which they used to irrigate the land and feed the artificial lakes in the city.<br />
<br />
--The great wall of Geihaki has never been broken nor penetrated by outsiders, surrounded by the natural protections of the desert and adding an army of soldiers upon the high walls to further protect the city.<br />
<br />
--Suna'Kemuri is the capital of the empire of the Suna'arahshi but there are other cities which were created years later, these cities are Suna'Asobi; Suna'Bokori and Suna'Bukuro.<br />
<br />
--These cities are located next to the south coast of the great desert and in spite their dislike for open sea the Suna have built docks and linked some of them via aqueducts to these great cities. They did all this to help with trade, particularly with the Merchants in the Lacanta Isles.<br />
<br />
--The Suna'Arashi empire is located in the south part of the great desert with the great wall marking the limits of the empire; it begins in the mid - west of the desert, a jagged edifice that ends in the south east; this wall has only one gateway.<br />
<br />
--They made a pact with the Thossak that a small (to them, in fact it is several hundreds leagues) breach between Eramor and the wall would be left untouched in order for them to maintain the trade route that benefits both races.<br />
<br />
--Within the walls dozens of roads have been created, all of them beautiful; the Suna'arashi use enormous &quot;vehicles&quot; that looks much like a carriage and others like wagons (but bigger and made out of hardened sand). The Suna'arashi use these to move from one place to another much faster; this works by levitating the sand that the vehicle's are composed with small movements or faster ones, depending upon the speed which they wish to travel at.<br />
<br />
--They use these contraptions in the cities and upon the roads inside their empire, not only for pleasure but to move troops, supplies and all kind of things.<br />
<br />
--The amount of sand a Suna'arashi can manipulate depends on their training mostly, mental and physical strength also play an important role. Mental power even more so because concentration is needed for using sand and the more difficult the labour the more concentration is needed. For example using sand to hit an enemy does not require the same amount of effort than using the sand to build a statue, as the second job much more precise and complicated and requires more concentration and is often done under pressure of time and body.<br />
<br />
--All the habitants in any of the four cities dress in colourful hues of clothes. These clothes are made of cotton and then painted with the peel of different fruits that are harvested from the trees that where born from the seeds they brought from Lenal. These clothing sets are usually composed of by a cloak, trousers, boots and shirt. Female Suna'arashi usually wear extravagant jewels and even the men were chains and earrings. Priests dress all in white robes, and warriors in black with golden fringed cuffs, and nobles where blue. Commoners dress any other colour, but this group in society is barely acknowledged and not treated any differently from any other class. This is due to the fact that Suna'arashi are very united, and respect each other. Social differentiation is almost useless, as it goes against what they desired for themselves upon Lenal. Equality.<br />
<br />
--Their history is recorded in the Sand Clock Book. It may look as one book but it is in truth hundreds of volumes. It is either an illusion or the information appears to the reader upon the pages, only the Suna priests know the truth of these things. Within this book they keep the record of their legends. It is guarded and kept in the suna'kemuri library.<br />
<br />
--There are huge squares all around the city, as well as shops, markets, theatres; it is a utopia for sandbenders.<br />
