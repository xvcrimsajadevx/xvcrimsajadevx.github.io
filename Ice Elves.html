<a name='_b_Ice_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Ice Elves</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Region:</b> The Ice Continent<a href="" title="Create page: The+Ice+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Samain Isles<a href="" title="Create page: Samain+Isles"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a><br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
White hair, pale skin, and albino eyes, the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> are always dressed in fur cloaks and thick animal skins. Furred boots upon their feet, they are stockier then the average alamia, looking like the average build of a hume. Weighed down with clothes to keep themselves warm, they keep them distinct from the humes by adorning themselves with furs and fabrics that even the most brave of humes could not acquire. They also will were less when meeting humes to prove they are physically stronger and are not as effected by the climate as their humes counterparts. The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> are still light on their feet and quick even when weighed down with these many layers of clothing. The pale features of these elves are harsher then their brothers and sisters on Lenal, more severe jaws and their ears bigger, their points sharper and more pronounced.<br />
<br />
Ice elves are often confused with mountain elves by the ignorant. The main way to tell these alamia apart is by their eyes. All ice elves have albino eyes, this is a very distinct feature and there are no exceptions. Also, unlike the mountain elves, ice elves tend to have a somewhat cruel aura about them. Sly grins often adorn their faces, their body language reflecting their xenophobic nature. Often aggressive and stand offish, one would not be wise to approach them, even to ask for help, if they are taking this kind of stance.<br />
<br />
The tall stature aids their tendency to loom and intimidate. Even though they are encumbered by thick clothing they are lithe. The ice elf females beauty is often hidden beneath the furs, their elven grace though is still able to shine through their tough exterior once they have shod the layers of clothing they hide beneath.<br />
<br />
The men are the most rugged of elves. However, this is also hidden by a beauty of their own as well as graceful body language. Their voices carry a piercing and commanding tone, an eerie sound that punctuates the ice wastes in <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a>. They dominate with their stature and their tone, overwhelming and disrupting most people, elf or hume, carrying a dangerous edge in this tone that can become easily threatening even in the most innocent of conversations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Xenophobic and extremely rude. Don't bother asking these elves for help as they would not give it. Un-trusting and particularly isolated, not much is known about their society other then what the Elves on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> reveal. The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> are contentious with the other alamia and are usually the ones to create opposition. Their representatives on the council make it difficult by not voting unanimously. This often causes conflict politically as well as between the average elves.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> of <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> are as close to hostile as elves become. They can be cruel, and use mainly offensive magic's when they use Titan's magic at all. They take an instant dislike to anyone they do not know, even other ice elves. Ardrains have a deep hatred and resentment for the humes of the Glacius Regnum<a href="" title="Create page: Glacius+Regnum"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which they share with the Ice Giants of <a title="Kurn" href='Kurn.html' class='wiki'>Kurn</a>. This 'friendship' often leads to humes who are lost in the Ice Wastes being captured and tortured by the giants. The ice elves deny any affiliation with the giants.<br />
<br />
Ice Elf nobility are the most pompous and arrogant of elves and their cruelty and malice cannot be matched. For a race of an origin these elves are very close to being cut off from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. The High Council of Elves suspects connections between the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> and the Ardrains but because of their limited access to the Sanctuary of <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a>, cannot investigate it.<br />
<br />
<a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> are sympathetic to their tainted brethren, and often voice how they wish they could bring back the <a title="Obsidian elves" href='Obsidian+elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian elves</a> into the fold of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. This is considered heresy amongst most alamia, and even though only the Ice Elf nobility would voice these opinions, the hearts of minds of the average Ice Elf (whether in <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> or Samain<a href="" title="Create page: Samain"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>) agrees with this dark and dangerous sentiment.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h2><b>History:</b></h2>
<br />
0E - The Making of the Elves<br />
<br />
- The Sundering of the Elves. Sub-races of elves were formed - these Alamia took on unique characteristics and traits depending on which part of nature they aligned themselves with. Some Alamia remain closer to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> than others, such as the Mountain and Forest elves whilst other such as the Ice elves segregated themselves completely from Lenal.<br />
<br />
1E-The <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> curses the elves with the Fading; they are no longer truly immortal.<br />
<br />
1E-The <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> curses the elves with the Fading; they are no longer truly immortal.<br />
<br />
-The Obsidian Elves are made, using <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>s children. Cut off from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, these Dark Elves are born with the power to use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> and have no connection to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. They were severed from the moment the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> tainted them. Only the half breeds have fully escaped this fate.<br />
<br />
-The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> leave Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and take their ships South, searching for colder regions. Some decide to go no further then the Samain Isles<a href="" title="Create page: Samain+Isles"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which are still a part of Elvenhome, the Continent of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a><br />
<br />
13E- The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> establish <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> as both a city and a region. The city is built upon the bedrock of Sanctuary - the only one known in the ice continent<a href="" title="Create page: ice+continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
327E- The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> refuse emissaries from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> access into <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a>. The Second Sundering takes place. They cut themselves off from Elvenhome for three hundred years.<br />
<br />
531E - The High Council of Elves is formed. The first meeting was in the Alumi Grove<a href="" title="Create page: Alumi+Grove"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
-Deleslaul Saleub and Oreguil Ulahia are chosen to travel to <a title="Vidonia" href='Vidonia.html' class='wiki'>Vidonia</a> to take their places on the Elven High Council as representatives of the Ice Elves.<br />
<br />
560E- The Great Alliance between <a title="Humans" href='Humans.html' class='wiki'>Humans</a>, <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a>, <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>, Elves and <a title="Dwarves" href='Dwarves.html' class='wiki'>Dwarves</a> is formed to combat the spread of the Darknes<a href="" title="Create page: Darknes"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>s over the Nether Realm and to help protect the Light Bearer<a href="" title="Create page: Light+Bearer"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>'s.<br />
<br />
-Ice Elves refuse to join the Alliance. Their representatives on the Elven Council resign.<br />
<br />
3773E- The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, upset over the Summit, refuse to aid the search for Orion<a href="" title="Create page: Orion"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The Forest Elves decide to search the Ice Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Ice+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> themselves but before they can leave Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are obstructed by the Ice Elves. The Battle of <a title="Naida" href='Naida.html' class='wiki'>Naida</a> ends with most of the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> leaving, others isolating themselves in a secluded part of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> - the Frozen Archipelago in the South of the continent. A bitter rift is established between the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> and the Forest Elves.<br />
<br />
5907E- A significant number of <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> return to Elvenhome. The common denominator being they are all over a thousand years old. The Council suspects that something has happened to Sanctuary, but access is still restricted by the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> who are left, ergo it cannot be investigated.<br />
<br />
6000E- present day<br />
