<b>Group Name:</b> The Children of the Waves<br />
<br />
<b>Race:</b> Hume<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Adenia<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Same as any ether user, longer then normal humes, not always as long as wizards.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance:</b></h1>
<br />
The Children mimic the style of dress of the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> priests and priestesses and tend to wear the same white cotton robes, trousers. These clothes differ from the Azail's by their blue embroidery around the cuffs, hems and necklines. They normally do not wear shoes and walk around their coastal communes bare footed. They wear a simple white robe for their water rituals made from the same clinging, stretchy material that the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> use, a material that cannot get wet.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h1><b>Personality Traits:</b></h1>
<br />
The Children are based all over <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> in community settlements, usually agricultural, pacifist and peaceful, and organized under collectivist principles. They are wary about outsiders unless they are willing to join them, and they tend to be very orthodox and single minded about their religion. They are focused on their goal to become <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a> and anyone who threatens their existence are removed. They are pacifist but they are not an easy target. Their communes are situated in very watery areas and they will use this water source in a defensive and sometimes destructive manner if they are under threat. This is highly unusual as the Adenians are generally peaceful, but the Children are seen as religious freaks who have gone too far.<br />
<br />
They are united by one ideal, to become <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>, and it is hard to penetrate that faith and dissuade any individual. Many seek out the children (ether users with a talent for hydromancy and wish to control it, others wishing to join the cult) but most are born into the cult. There are some individuals are are born without the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> ability and are kept around to help farm and maintain the commune. Those who cannot ascend to <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a> are often seen as outsiders, even those born in the commune and are excluded from the religion and every day life. Some accept this and stay, some leave the Children and seek to live the rest of their short hume lives elsewhere in <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a>, or other parts of the world.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History:</b></h1>
<br />
Snippet of the timeline<br />
<br />
<b>232E-</b> Azaili Acolytes of <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a> are given permission to teach the Adenians about the Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They remain for 50 years.<br />
<br />
Some magic users travel to <a title="Azaliz" href='Azaliz.html' class='wiki'>Azaliz</a> and are bonded with a stronger magic to <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a>. These humans are known as the Children of the Waves and they are adept in water majicks. They become the human acolytes and replace the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> who must return to the oceans. The new religion for magic users in <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> has the ultimate goal of becoming <a title="Water Magi" href='Water+Magi.html' class='wiki'>Water Magi</a>. Those who reach this status either leave <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> forever and live with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>, or they remain deep in the temples to teach other the path to the Waves.<br />
<br />
<b>1300E-</b> Proclamation of Silence. This lasts for a millennium. The <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> only have contact with the Adenians. the Silence is decreed as a reaction to the ever growing darkness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only some of these Chosen Adenian's became Acolytes of <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a> and still teach in Azures temples throughout Adenia, and some became the Children of the Waves. Over the centuries the Acolytes customs and teachings and that of the Children have grown apart, the Children obsessed with the Path to <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>, the Acolytes dedicated to their calling teaching Adenians the Path to the Waves. This is more a religion then a cult and the Acolytes teach ether users and non ether users alike. The Azail still support this religion (Path to the Waves) but tend to leave the Children to their business. The Azail neither approve or disapprove of the Children.<br />
<br />
It is believed by the Children that the Ascended Ones do indeed live with the Azail, and in part this may be true. The Children of the Waves do not approve of Magi dwelling/serving in the water temples, but as these Magi are Acolytes and not former Children so they tend to dismiss them and commune only with the former Children.<br />
<br />
Understandably over the centuries these two religions have grown far apart. They came from the same root, a small group of Adenian's who were taught powerful water majicks by the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> in Azailiz<a href="" title="Create page: Azailiz"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, but once they returned to <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> they drifted apart. Some remained in the temples after the Azail left and the proclamation of Silence commenced, and the Children sought the shores and the oceans, desiring to be with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> again and dwell under the water and be a part of Azure for eternity. This desire led them down the Path to <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>, whereas the Acolytes in the temples led the Adenian people to the Path to the Waves, reassuring them that the Azaili silence was not their fault, and <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a> still loved them and wanted to help and protect them.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly it was the Acolytes who gained the most followers, their words of comfort backed up by <a title="Adenia" href='Adenia.html' class='wiki'>Adenia</a> never being ravaged by war (either invaded or by civil war), and reinforced by the fact that the Acolytes welcomed all, the Children turning away non ether users. Whereas the Children cut themselves off from the world and became obsessed with their spiritual goal. The Children are not abhorred in Adenia, they are made fun off (on the rare occasions they enter the villages, towns, farms and cities of Adenia) and sometimes feared (for the state of <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a> is a mystery to most, only the <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> and <a title="Sorcerers" href='Sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>Sorcerers</a> and other learned ones knowing the truth behind Magi).<br />
<br />
To this day the Children and Acolytes still practice their variations of the same religion, and the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> are now once more amongst them (moreso the Acolytes in their temples then the Children.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick:</b></h1>
<br />
Water majicks taught by the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> thousands of years ago. These spells have been passed down by the generations of Children and were specially adapted by the Azail for humes ether majick. These spells are not widely known and only members of the cult know their specifics. It is believed only the Children can cast these water majicks and that they are the most proficient water mages in the world (a fact that may be debated by the Acolytes, although the Acolytes focus on teaching the religion and not perfecting their water majick. Only the leaders of temples could probably rival the Children in spell casting). <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> would call them untrained but their schooling is as vigorous and demanding as the training on the isles, and the Children are as well trained as the Shamans.<br />
<br />
As water is, along with Earth, the hardest element to master it takes years (from 50 to 500) for the Children to become as proficient as a young Azaili. They work hard at their craft and focus on becoming one with the water. They seek to have the element flow through them instead of touching it with the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> as only humes can. Once the element touches their soul they ascend to <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>. It is a very spiritual and lengthy process and some of the Children never achieve this status.<br />
<br />
For those who do become Magi a seemingly unique thing happens. Madness is not a side effect of the change and many water magi maintain their sanity and sense of self. As a result the Children commune with their former members come magi, but this is rare. Another part of their learning is swimming far out to sea and calling to their ascended brethren and sistren. In the deep ocean they are taught one on one by these ascended humes. Some liken this to the shamans test in the Desert of Teran A'ao. It is their first rite of passage and many die and ultimately fail. It is a test of strength, spirituality and desire and only the strongest survive and continue on the Path of Magi.<br />
<br />
It is not a rule of thumb that all water magi that were once children retain their sense of self, return to their former people, or keep their sanity. Accidents happen, and even with the slowest of processes some humes lose control and the change is forced upon them early. The Children believe the madness is a punishment for haste. They have many prayers to <a title="Azure" href='Azure.html' class='wiki'>Azure</a> that ward against impatience and lack of control and pray for guidance and strength to tame the waters. Insanity is the greatest fear and they treat such <a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a> as a taboo.<br />
<br />

<b>Religious Rites:</b><br />
<br />
The Path of Magi consists of several stages, culminating in Ascension. Only those intimate with the cult know these rites of passage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magi_in_Temples_b_'></a><h2><b>Magi in Temples:</b></h2>
<br />
<a title="Magi" href='Magi.html' class='wiki'>Magi</a>, by definition are chaotic and act like the element they have become, but the Temple Magi are the most sentient and are the ones who have retained most of their former hume selves. These Magi were all once Acolytes. Their process to Magi is similar to the Children in only one way - time and control. It is rare for an Acolyte to lose control and they are aided in recent centuries by a faction of Azail (known as the Zealots) in becoming Magi. These <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> believe that humes should be aided more directly in becoming a part of the element they were born from and love so much. Indeed they believe the Magi are the key to finding a cure to their curse that inflicts the Azail, the Hetacomb<a href="" title="Create page: Hetacomb"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Once a leader of the temple has completed this turning they take the place of the last serving Magi who is then free to the waters of the world. Each Dynasty in each temple depends on how long the leader of that temples takes to turn Magi, but it is normally between 100 and 1500 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magi_with_the_Azail_b_'></a><h2><b>Magi with the Azail:</b></h2>
<br />
These Magi are generally former Temple Magi, and for the most part former Children. The Azail welcome them to their Empire but the nature of Magi dictates that they cannot stay for long in any organised society. The Zealots are often the ones the Magi (who are craving their hume existence) seek out as it is they who are the most accepting and understanding of this 'race'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magi_that_return_to_the_Children_b_'></a><h2><b>Magi that return to the Children:</b></h2>
<br />
Longing, regret, sometimes duty causes these Magi to return. Rarely do they come close enough to be with their former people so openly, on most occasions it is only during the first Rites of the younger Children that they return.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Important_Note_b_'></a><h1><b>Important Note:</b></h1>
<br />
Not all Children become Magi, and <a title="Water Magi" href='Water+Magi.html' class='wiki'>Water Magi</a> are extremely rare. The process is long, about 1/100 people in this Realm (the entire hume population) can even use the ether and out of those only 1/50 ether users have a talent for Hydromancy. A low percentage of Children or Acolytes become Magi. Magi are not numerous and there are not loads of water magi floating around the Nether Realm!<br />
