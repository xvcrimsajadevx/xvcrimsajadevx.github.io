<br />
<br />
<i><div align="center">'In the beginning there was Nothing. The Nothing, Emptiness, Silence. A Great Lightening tore the Nothing and suddenly there was Light. The Light was Creation...it was life...it was good. And so the Light was divided and half of the Nothing became the Darkness.</div></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaos ruled. Chaos and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Emptiness and nothingness filled the Void. There was no time, no life... no Divinity. Only raw power, raging, ready, waiting. When the Divine Lightning sparked Existence, Nothing separated. On one side was the Light...and on the other, the Darkness. So the Dawn of Time preceded, and life was breathed into the Void, Chaos dispelled.<br />
<br />
These two primal forces were placed upon the fulcrum of existence, the Light poised precariously on one side, and the Darkness on the other. The Light and the Darkness being the first born of the Void and the Divine Lightning, were the first to create out of the Nothing. They were the Order and Chaos of the Universes, the two opposing forces that balance all worlds. This balance had to be maintained or Existence would fall once again to Chaos.<br />
<br />
The Light created All Worlds. Wherever their was life, there was a world of Light.<br />
The Origins came from the Light as the worlds took form. Born from the elements that made the worlds the Origins formed them and had power over them. Azure made the Oceans, Titan the lands and mountains, Pyra heated the core of the worlds, and caused the volcanoes to erupt with molten fires, and Tempest formed the clouds, commanded the rains to fall and the winds to rage. The Origins were the true Gods of All Worlds, all powerful in their Elements.<br />
<br />
Humans were the first race of the Light, and made after the Worlds were created, and after the Origins and their progeny and worlds. The Darkness, ruing the Lights creation, sought to destroy it. It cursed all races with Death, dooming their souls to its Other Worlds, to Oblivion. Human souls, possessing fragments of the Light, were effected the worst. They were cursed with complete mortality, living no longer then a few score years. With each death of a human a portion of the Light was lost forever, doomed to Oblivion for eternity.<br />
<br />
The Darkness created The Other Worlds; demon worlds and Hell Dimensions, made to trap the souls of men, and destroy everything the Light created. Only death and darkness, evil and malcontent existed in the Other Worlds. The races of the Darkness were the Undead, the Vampyres, and the twisted Obsidian Elves. The Obsidian Elves were elves by name and appearance only. They were creatures of shadow and served the Darkness as Minions. Once they were bonded to Titan, but they were cast off when the Darkness twisted there souls. Cut off from the Origin the Obsidian Elves evolved with Dark Powers, some were even born with the power to use the Ether and born sorcerers.<br />
<br />
War continued to rage between the Light and the Darkness. Worlds were destroyed, men fought men, elf fought elf. The ramifications of these conflicting powers caused a ripple throughout Existence. It was a spark of neutrality, the final Primal Power. The Ether- a force of neutral power that existed in All Worlds and on all plains of existence. It was however the strongest in the Nether Realm, from whence the ripple started. From the Ether came the Djinn. These beings were the embodiment of this new power, the Ether itself not being a sentient being, it channelled its power into the Djinn. Each Djinn represented an aspect of creation, the part they felt most affinity with. By humans they were worshipped as gods, and some of the Djinn accepted a following, and led them. Some however maintained their neutrality by remaining aloof from the world of men, neither gods nor devils, just existing, and maintaining balance.<br />
<br />
At the same time the Djinn came into being, the Ether touched the Shadow Plane. A place that existed outside time and space, a bubble in the creation, it filled with the Ether and the shadows of the Djinn were created there. They called themselves the Eria, the Shadows.<br />
<br />
Humans soon after started to be born with the ability to use the Ether. Inborn magical powers led the first of them to establish the schools of wizardry and sorcery. Soon after the Circle of Wizards was founded and the Council of Sorcerers. Not long after, the first summoner was touched by the Eria Abeona from the Shadow Realm. Zaci caused the island of Aether to rise up from the ocean. The Eria name their people the Quasi and tribes begin to form all over the Nether Realm. Gathered by the Eria they make Aether their home. Summoners start to be born in the Nether Realm as well as made.<br />
<br />
The Light fears losing All Worlds to the Darkness, so in a desperate attempt to preserve itself, it chose three souls and imbued them with all of its power. These three came to be known as Light Bearers. Aurora - a Wizard from Sedana, Orion - a forest elf from Eramor, and Anais - a human from Glacialis Regnum, become the three most powerful individuals in the Nether Realm, nay in All Worlds. The Darkness twisted 13 souls and made the Thyrza to challenge the Light Bearer's. These 13 were the generals of the Minions of Darkness and their soul purpose was to hunt the Light Bearers and destroy them. The Adair - Apprentices of the Thyrza- were added to the dark ranks. Whenever the Thyrza are destroyed their apprentice replaced them. The Legion of Darkness filled All Worlds, waging a victorious war on all planes of existence.<br />
<br />
The Light Bearers fled to the Nether Realm, the last world of Light, and set up their defences. Aurora built the Province of Yaquinta, Anais the Vallumglacia, and Orion forged his jewels and hid in his temple on the Nexus.<br />
<br />
The Great Alliance between Humans, Dragons, Azail, Elves and Dwarves was formed to combat the spread of the Darkness over the Nether Realm and to help protect the Light Bearer's. Eramor is the centre of this alliance and is a strong land filled with the races of the Origins and a haven for humans also. Friendships are forged within the alliance, as well as animosities. The Dragon Queen Tiamat moves to overthrow Nado, as she believed allying with other races was beneath them. When her children backed Nado she rebelled, taking her kindreds with her to the Dark Continent where she became a Thyzra.<br />
<br />
The Triad (Tiamat, Hydra and Leviathan) wreak havoc in the Nether Realm. They destroy the island colonies and ravage the Eastern Continent. A huge battle was fought in Oceana between the Azail King, Ahto and Queen, Elektra. They use the jewel of Orion, Azure to imprison the Triad, but die in the process. As a punishment for her betrayal, Tiamat has her wings removed by Nado and she is banished to the Oceans forever.<br />
<br />
The Great Alliance is no more. The Azail leave, breaking off their long standing alliance with the Dragons, betrayed by the acts of Tiamat and grieving the loss of their king and queen they seal their cities and leave only Urzaliz open to other races. The dragons sever all contact with the world and are not seen for a millennia. The nations of Avalon cannot be allied with each other and bring nothing but chaos to the war against the Darkness. Humans torn, the races divided, hope fails and the Darkness looks to cover the Nether Realm completely... The Five Races live separately, only trading with one another, and fighting the war in their own lands and in their own way.<br />
<br />
Annais, King of Glacius Regnum goes missing. He cannot be found anywhere in the Ice Continent and the Wizarding Council fears the worst. His wizard advisor is found murdered by the ambassadors sent to investigate.<br />
<br />
When Annais finally returns the Wizards send five representatives to question Annais. The King explains that he had secret business to attend to and that he could not tell a soul where he was going for fear the Thyrza would find out. Leaving the Ice Continent was too dangerous for him and he knew the Wizards would try and stop him. Some of the representatives believed him, but one did not. Arcana reported to Arcemedes and the Head of Invokation ordered spies to the Glacius Regnum.<br />
<br />
To ensure the safety of Annais, the mountain elves raise the Great Wall of Ice, otherwise known as the Vallumglacia. It is made by magic but also a natural feature, and the greatest work of the mountain elves to date. It is over a thousand feet high, un-scalable, three miles thick and can only be passed through via a portal which Annais controls. Within it are the barracks for the army of the Ice Kingdom, a network of tunnels, a grand city spidering inside the ice, supporting millions of citizens and soldiers.<br />
<br />
The great city of Volatilis begins trading with other races. They have a special trade with dragons and the winged elves but refuse to deal directly with the Dwarves. Animosity grows and soon dwarves are banned from even the trade quarter and docks of Volatilis. Avalon has limited trade, Nyoryn benefiting most. They trade goods for land so the Alatus are able to grow more food to support their population. More Alatus are seen in the world, although breeding with other races is strictly forbidden (if not always adhered to).<br />
<br />
A hundred years later the dragons mysteriously vanish from the mountains of Avalon. Some believe they are called back to Nadozenith, some that they merely died, succumbing to the Dwindling that cursed their race. A disease that killed them off and left the Nether Realm without its oldest race. For centuries not a single dragon was seen.<br />
<br />
Three hundred years later magic is outlawed in Sedana. The Sovereign is killed by a wizard, the wizard put to trial but escaping from the gallows. It wasn't known at the time to the people of Sedana, but the wizard who was accused was the Light Bearer, Aurora. Intrigue, plotting and betrayal cause Sedana to cut themselves off from the rest of Avalon, causing a rift between them and the rest of the nations of Avalon for many centuries and millennia to come.<br />
<br />
Three centuries later, Aurora takes refuge on Meru. Protected by the Orbis Venificus she stays with them for over a thousand years. Many believed she should have remained there, but she could not tarry forever. Destiny moved her and in 4000E she fled the Nether Realm through Orion's gate. With child and hunted by Shiloh.<br />
<br />
Around 3000E Orion goes missing. The elves call a summit, and search for him, but he is not found. Athros Longbranch and his brother set sail for Eramor and take many ships with Forest Elves with them. New members of the Council are chosen to replace them. They build the City of Eladin in the Emerald Forest upon Sanctuary and are sustained and protected from the fading as long as they remain in Eramor.<br />
<br />
Five thousand Existence sees the worst disaster in the history of the Nether Realm. The Nexus causes a major earthquake in Avalon, and the country of Gallian is utterly destroyed. A mountain range replaces the fallen country, its ruins and remnants hidden in the stone. The city of the Winged Elves is the only place that was not destroyed. Survivors of Gallian believe the gods have punished them and they scatter. Their blood is diluted amongst the peoples of Avalon, running strongest in Fenlar. The Dragons however, return to Avalon and take refuge in the Mountains of Gallian.<br />
<br />
Soon after, the dragon queen Tiamat escapes her Ocean Prison near Azaliz. The Azail hunt her but she is not re-captured. She goes to the Dark Continent where she is reinstated as a Thyrza and bequeathed even more power. She is changed and savaged by the ocean, forever holding a grudge against the Azail and swearing vengeance upon them. Creating more of her Shadow Kindreds she is not seen for many hundreds of years again, her Adair doing her bidding in the world and gathering her power in the Forbidden Isles. The Obsidian Elves serve her faithfully.<br />
<br />
Under the command of Ilshara, Tiamat's Adair, and on the order of Tiamat, the Obsidian Elves launch an attack on Aether. The island is utterly destroyed and the Quasi and Vigilia decimated. The Quasi become a nomadic people. The Vigilia punish themselves for failing in their oath.<br />
<br />
In 5700E Terah gives the Alatus a Weather Device. Hidden and never to be used as a weapon the Alauts protect it fiercely, only the Royal family knowing of its whereabouts and able to access it. When it goes missing the entire family are under suspicion. House Ayperi is dethroned and House Enlil takes its place. Ayperi is never trusted again.<br />
<br />
5710 is recorded to be the start of the century of Turmoil. The worst weather in the entire history of the Nether Realm hit in this year and continued for a hundred years. The wizard Arcemedes confirmed that there had been nothing like it, ever. The entire world is thrown into peril. Every race is effected and many in Avalon die as it is concentrated on the human continent. Avalon is ravaged by extreme weather for 100 years. The Wizards of Meru and the Quasi use the Ether and the Eria to readdress the balance of the weather.<br />
<br />
Another tragedy follows some years later. A sign that the Darkness is consuming the Nether Realm. The Winged Elves and their Thunderdrake Dragons are utterly destroyed by the Obsidian Elves. Commanded yet again by Ilshara. Only a few survive and they return to Nadozenith and Lenal. Secretly a few stay on in Avalon and build up their numbers again.<br />
<br />
Presently the kingdoms of Avalon are on the brink of war, the dwarves are isolated in Eramor. The elves do not stir from Lenal in great numbers and the dragons keep to their kindred territories. The Azail will trade only, as will the Alatus and the Darkness merely sleeps. Trepidation and foreboding cast a shadow on the future...<br />
