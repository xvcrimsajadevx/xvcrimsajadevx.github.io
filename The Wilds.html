The south western borders of the northern regions is where the Wilds are located. The shores of the Sea of Daerin to the Umikabi, then south to the Marshes the Wastes and the Great Desert, the Wilds are lands that are green but dangerous. Hundreds of miles of the Wilds separate Malikar from the Great Desert and the Great Trade Route runs through the Wilds and towards the Chagri Mountains that go from Umikabi to the Rift. There are mountain passes through these mountains but Trolls and Rock Giants with bad tempers live in those mountians and attack travellers who attempt the trails through them.<br />
