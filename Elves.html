<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> The elves are all over the Nether Realm. But Elvenhome is Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, a small continent to the south west of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b><br />
<br />
Elves are one of the immortal races and as such do not succumb to physical illnesses and diseases. But the curse of the darkness makes them start to fade once they reach around 1,000 years old. When this starts to happen they have to return to Elvenhome or die. They do not show physical signs of ageing past their 20's, and can be killed in battle. This is also part of the curse.<br />
<br />
Elves have pregnancies of seven months, but the birth rate of elves is much lower then that, say, of <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a>. Elves do not tend to have more then two or three children. Legend says though, that as the elf population on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> swells, the continent grows with them...<br />

<br />
<b>Allegiance:</b> All but the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> are aligned with the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> and with <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
After the Sundering the general appearance of elves changed drastically. The only thing they truly had in common with each other were their pointed ears. They split into alamia, each type of elf evolving according to their environment. It is believed that the one's who had the most drastic changes (the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a> and the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a>) had help in their evolution. The Water alamia simply mixed their elven blood with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>. This did not produce a half race though, as the children born were still full elves, they were elves with traits of the underwater race. After the first generation of mixed blood they did not mate with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> again, yet their children retained all the attributes of the first generation.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a> had help from the Air Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a>. <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> and <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a> assisted the evolution of the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a>, as they desired flight with all their hearts. The evolution continued through the generations, as it did with the other types of alamia, and so the Sundering was complete.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
It depends on the type of elf really. <a title="Forest Elves" href='Forest+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Forest Elves</a> tend to be very friendly and immersed in nature. <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a> are pragmatic and practical. <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> are as cold as their environment, and even rude and xenophobic with other elves. <a title="Water elves" href='Water+elves.html' class='wiki'>Water elves</a> are elusive and shy and <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a> tend to be wise and dreamy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
The Elves of the Nether Realm were the third race to be created after the Light made the Universes. They are the First Born of the Earth Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, which he calls simply, 'Eldest'. Elves are immortal yet they can be killed. Mortal illnesses and old age cannot touch them but they can lose their life in battle, and due to unnatural causes.<br />
<br />
Elves vary depending on where you are in the world. Before mortals can remember many Elves have left Lenal and migrated all over the Nether Realm. So a forest elf from Tragorian<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is extremely different from a forest elf on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
After the First Sundering, the elves evolved. Some with the help of <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>, some becoming a sort of half elven race. The Forest Elves and the Mountain elves stayed closest to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, and are the purest form of elf and the closest in looks and magic to those who first awoke in the Grove of the Alumi Tree.<br />
<br />
The Elves of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> do not speak of those who chose a darker path. The Severance is something every elf fears, and cannot comprehend any other elf doing it by choice. The Elves who chose the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and became the <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> after the first Sundering are not considered elves by those who are still a part of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
Elves can only use Earth Majicks, all spells come from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. Each alamia has variations of the earth majicks, and have additions of their own too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Added_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Added Information</b></h1>
<br />
The Light Bearer<a href="" title="Create page: Light+Bearer"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Orion<a href="" title="Create page: Orion"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is an elf.<br />
<br />
There is no list of elven noble houses as they are not as numerous or as widely known as human nobles. Some alamia do not even refer to those of High Blood as nobility, and their high blood do not rise themselves above the status of those around them. Most alamia consider the mountain elves high blood to be what other races would call 'nobility', and if a human asked who was the royalty of their race, even a winged elf would most likely name the Eldest Houses of the Mountain Elves. Only the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> and Mountain Elves have any structure to their nobility (and by structure I mean that they have an elevated status within their society, wealth is a gauge as to how pure a nobles blood is, they foster nepotism, and even their culture and language is different from their fellow alamia, some would even consider it more sophisticated.). These 'nobles' are considered higher blood because they are one of the first elves who awoke in the Alumi Grove, or they are a direct descendent of an elf who did. This is the only distinction in Elven Society and for most alamia not even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Alamia_b_'></a><h1><b>The Alamia</b></h1>
<br />
The word <i>alamia</i> means 'divided', or different. This word is the opposite of the meaning of &quot;alumi&quot; which means 'together'. The &quot;alamia&quot; of Elves is their word for their differences. The Winged Elf &quot;Alamia&quot;, Forest Elf &quot;Alamia&quot;, these are the titles they give to themselves and each other, as its by their differences that they distinguish.All are elf, but not all are the same. When the Elders chose their paths in this world the elves were divided, and it is only through &quot;alumi&quot; or death that they will be whole again.<br />
<br />
After the Sundering (when the Elders chose different paths) the general appearance of elves changed drastically. The only thing they truly had in common with each other were their pointed ears. They split into &quot;alamia&quot;, each type of elf evolving according to their environment. It is believed that the one's who had the most drastic changes the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a> and the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> had help in their evolution. The Water &quot;alamia&quot; simply mixed their elven blood with the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>. This did not produce a half race though, as the children born were still full elves, they were elves with traits of the underwater race. After the first generation of mixed blood they did not mate with the Azail again, yet their children retained all the attributes of the first generation.<br />
<br />
The Winged Elves had help from the Air Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a>. <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> and <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a> assisted the evolution of the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a>, as they desired flight with all their hearts.

<a name='_b_The_Seven_Sanctuaries_b_'></a><h1><b>The Seven Sanctuaries</b></h1>
<br />
The Seven Sanctuaries are;<br />
<br />
<b>Eladin</b><br />
<b>Yaenara</b><br />
<b>Ardra</b><br />
<b>The Temple of Cephas</b><br />
<b>Tragorian Forest</b><br />
<b>The Island of Time</b><br />
<b>Titan’s Cove</b><br />
<br />
When the Elves were cursed with the Fading it was only the magic of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> that protected them from total mortality. The Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> was always close to the Eldest of his Races and so the Elves received the bulk of his protection. From then on, as long as they were physically close to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> they would not Fade into Nothingness.<br />
<br />
The Rock of Ages is <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, it is the Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> of Earth incarnate. Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is not a mere continent, it IS the Rock. This is why the Elves named it ‘Elvenhome’. Upon Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> is every tree, every rock, the earth and soil underfoot, he is the mountains, the flowers… he IS Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The place the Elves call the Rock of Ages is - quite literally - his head. Sometimes <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> animates the Rock of Ages, and awakens, imbuing it with his energy. He does this when he wishes to speak to his Eldest, to the Council Members or to his devoted priests and priestesses.<br />
<br />
As the tip of an iceberg sometimes breaks through the waves so does the Rock of Ages all over the Nether Realm; these places where edifices break the ground asunder are like the tip of an iceberg. The mass beneath the earth, the bedrock that is <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, the Rock of Ages connects all these jutting stone monoliths like the branches of a tree are attached to the trunk. These branches are places of power for the Elves and infuse the surrounding area with the veil of protection Elvenhome offers, but on a smaller scale. These pieces of rock are not as powerful as the Rock of Ages that is a mass above ground upon Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, but these places are powerful enough to keep the Fading at bay.<br />
<br />
Many Elves have lived for thousands of years without ever leaving a Sanctuary, yet all Elves outside of Elvenhome feel its pull. They yearn for Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, for the closeness of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. Most Elves, particularly on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> believe that an elf should not stay away from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> permanently, that all should make the journey to her shores and remain there forever, basking in the Glory of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> and the Grove of Alumi. They believe that the power of Sanctuary is nothing compared to that of Elvenhome. It is like living a half life; everything is dimmer and blurred. The trees do not pulse with life, the earth does not sing. These elves in Sanctuary are simply alive, they are not really living. Sanctuary is supposed to be just that - a sanctuary from Death, somewhere to rejuvenate and take rest. Elvenhome, however, fills Elves with Light, Sanctuary merely keeps them attached to this world.<br />
<br />
Some Elves choose to fade, some choose Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and for the rest there is the blessing of Sanctuary.<br />
<br />
Please note: for those elves who have never been to Elvenhome, life is not as dim as those on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> would have you believe. You cannot miss what you have never known - BUT all elves yearn to be closer to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, that is in their very nature and the heart of what they are. Some are just content with Sanctuary; and some welcome Death.<br />

<a name='_b_Eladin_b_'></a><h2><b>Eladin</b></h2>
<br />
The Forest gate road leads from the south of Eramor from the coast to a fork on the outskirts of the Emerald Forest. Here it merges with the Harbour Road and it winds its way through the forest and to the gates of the Elven Sanctuary of Eladin<a href="" title="Create page: Eladin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Known as ‘The White City’, its sheer and smooth walls rise high above the canopy of the surrounding forest, gleaming in the sunlight and at night emitting an effulgent glow. Inside the City walls there is a blend of forest and the white rock of the ancient city. Forest elf abodes are high in the canopy of the gnarled trees as well as settled between the enormous roots. The elves here dwell amidst rock and tree in harmony.<br />
<br />
The landmark and focus of the city is the beautiful, ivory castle of King Athros. The former forest elf high councillor is the founder of Eladin<a href="" title="Create page: Eladin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the protector of this Sanctuary. Eladin<a href="" title="Create page: Eladin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is a bright and beautiful jewel in the centre of the wild Emerald Forest and is built upon the bedrock of the Rock of Ages. The castle is unusual, some attributing this to it being carved from the Sanctuary Rock itself. The White Walls are also a part of the Sanctuary Rock, attached to the outer walls of the castle, the cities northern wall suffused into the back of the castle. The power of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> surrounds and supports the city.<br />
<br />
When Athros arrived he found only one jutting rock in the middle of a vacant grove in the dark and wild forest. No elf knows how the castle and city were built, as Athros came back to the ships and led his people to the City. Elf legends say that <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> himself carved out a castle for the forest elf and built the city around it. The castles interior is enchanted. Its passageways magically shifting, no corridor staying the same; it is vaster inside then it appears from the outside. Anyone who goes through the castle who is not of elven blood unaccompanied will be lost as only elves can change the inside of the castle to suits their needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Yaenara_b_'></a><h2><b>Yaenara</b></h2>
<br />
The Winged Elf City is the oldest of all the elf sanctuaries. It was built by the mountain elves upon Sanctuary as a safe haven for the delicate alamia of the winged elves. Carved deep into the eastern end of the Mountains of Gallian<a href="" title="Create page: Gallian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> was hidden to all but the elves and <a title="dragons" href='dragons.html' class='wiki'>dragons</a> by the mountain elves strong enchantments.<br />
<br />
The city is vast and is in fact the size of a small country. The aeries of the winged elves distinguished it from any other mountain elf made city. Its architecture is unique and never matched by anything else the mountain elves went on to make. The cavernous halls and buildings of the lower city are reserved for the non winged alamia. The mountain elves built many strongholds here, believing that any breach of their magical defences would come in the lower city. Vaulted ceilings, monolithic edifices carved from the mountains of Gallian<a href="" title="Create page: Gallian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, lofty, narrow, ivory bridges, towers abd aeries - both elven and dragon<a href="" title="Create page: dragon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> - make this city an awesome sight to behold. Upon the highest mountain is a flat area that caps the peak which is used as a meeting place. It is a roofless stone circle that is large enough for even the dragon inhabitants of the city. The pillars within the stone circle of Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are believed to be the true Rock of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, and are the focal point of the city. It is only accessible by flight as the sides of the mountain are too treacherous with sharp, jagged rocks to climb.<br />
<br />
Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> can only be entered through the mountains by those who have been to the City before. The first time one visits Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> has to be by air; this is part of the enchantment the mountain elves placed upon it. Entrances to Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are believed to be in <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a>, Teran A’ao<a href="" title="Create page: Teran+A%E2%80%99ao"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and <a title="Fenlar" href='Fenlar.html' class='wiki'>Fenlar</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Ardra_b_'></a><h2><b>Ardra</b></h2>
<br />
The ancient city (and land) of the ice elves lies inside the great ice wall of <a title="Vallumglacia" href='Vallumglacia.html' class='wiki'>Vallumglacia</a>, half way between the wall and the hume city if Glacius Regnum<a href="" title="Create page: Glacius+Regnum"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. As it was the mountain elves who built the ice wall the ice elves have long tried to lay claim to it. It annoys them, however, that it is the King of the Humes of Glacius Regnum<a href="" title="Create page: Glacius+Regnum"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> that has control over it. Elves are free to come and go through it but only the ice elves can enter without permission from Annias<a href="" title="Create page: Annias"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
<a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> is situated on the northern ice plains. The boundaries of their land, which they also call <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> changes depending on the mood of the ice elves; but there are few ice elves who dwell outside of the great city, or indeed the valley with it lies in. They live near the humes but do not trust them. Refusing to let them enter their city unless they beg; ice elf guards have been known to turn away wayfarers who have then gone on to die in the desolation of the ice wastes.<br />
<br />
The city is a forlorn place; the climate not reason it is a cold place to be. The architecture is boring, their ice palaces no where near as grand as those on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are immense buildings, but they are empty and silent. They have no heart; like those who inhabit them. <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> is at the bottom of a deep and vast valley, surrounded and protected by the Encircling Mountains and cut off from the pathetic humes by a wide and deep fissure to the south. The Ameda Bridge<a href="" title="Create page: Ameda+Bridge"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is the longest in the world and breaches the fissure, and is the only way across it, the only entrance into <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a>. It was made by the ice elves, a feat they believe outstrips anything the mountain elves have ever built, including the <a title="Vallumglacia" href='Vallumglacia.html' class='wiki'>Vallumglacia</a>. They made two statues they call the Sentinels which guard the only entrance into the city. Two monolithic white statues, their faces resembling hume woman and their bodies that of griffins. They have been imbued with strange ice elf magics and will not allow passage to anyone not of ice elf blood. Their eyes glow when someone who is not an ice elf steps across the threshold. If the person does not hastily turn back or the elf guards do not placate the Sentinels then the eyes shoot a beam of bright light and turn the stranger to stone. These petrified visitors are never healed and instead thrown into the fissure to the south.<br />
<br />
<a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> is invisible, but not via any elf magic. The snow and blends with the white buildings, hiding it from the air. If you did not know a city existed you would not see anything there but an empty valley covered in snow. Once past the Sentinels it is hard to locate, especially in the dark. <a title="Ardra" href='Ardra.html' class='wiki'>Ardra</a> is not a welcoming place, and even though it is an elven Sanctuary few other alamia venture here through choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Temple_of_Cephas_b_'></a><h2><b>The Temple of Cephas</b></h2>
<br />
Even though the mountain elves are not the most numerous of elven alamia, they are the alamia most other races come into contact with. they are almost as numerous as the forest elves but it is their stone masonry that make them the most sought after and the most willing to mix with other races. For this reason they have many colonies throughout the Nether Realm, their largest being in the small country of <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a>.<br />
<br />
Located in the south of the country and nestled upon the northern slopes of the Mountains of Gallian<a href="" title="Create page: Gallian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, the mountain elves settled around and upon the most notable Sanctuary Rock. However, they were not the first to settle here. They arrived some time after someone had built a temple upon <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>s Rock of Ages. The rock was an entire mountain and atop it was a strange edifice that no human or elf had built. The first elf settlers climbed the mountain and entered the temple, discovering that it was in fact built by the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, <a title="Cephas" href='Cephas.html' class='wiki'>Cephas</a>. Out of respect to the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> they did not build upon the mountain, but instead made their Sanctuary in the foothills and in the roots of her mountain.<br />
<br />
<a title="Cephas" href='Cephas.html' class='wiki'>Cephas</a> came to respect these elves, drawn to them because of their mutual affinity. She offered them her friendship, and spent most of her time in this, her favourite of temples. The elf colony grew, and swelled until it was the largest Sanctuary in the Nether Realm. It is also the largest gathering of Mountain Elves outside of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Tragorian_Forest_b_'></a><h2><b>Tragorian Forest</b></h2>
<br />
The forest elf Finril was the cousin of King Athros of Eladin<a href="" title="Create page: Eladin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and a fellow high councillor for the forest elves on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. He, along with Athros, left Elvenhome with a large contingent of forest elves, to explore the lands outside of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and discover a Sanctuary of their own. Once Athros had established Eladin<a href="" title="Create page: Eladin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Finril decided to go further in <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a> and so he led his own people into the unknown to search for another Sanctuary that they could call home. Having battled trolls and goblins and all manner of feel beasts, he was about to turn back and return to the Sanctuary of his kinsman, when he found the Forest now called Tragorian<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. He searched under its eaves and came upon broken stone circle. Feeling its immense power he knew he had found a branch of the Rock of Ages. Its power emanated throughout the forest, blessing all who walked under its canopy.<br />
<br />
In the shadow of the Goblin Mountain Finril settled his people in the forest. His people flourished here, and became stronger, filled with the Light that Sanctuary blessed them with. They were on the frontier surrounded by dark races and fell beasts, but it was they who held them back, allowing the lands south of them to enjoy the freedom of <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a> without living in fear. They maintained and patrolled the highways and the trade routes, allowing merchants to cross <a title="Eramor" href='Eramor.html' class='wiki'>Eramor</a> in safety.<br />
<br />
No city did Finril build. The rock of ages was marked only by the broken stone circle he found deep in the forest. This was hallowed ground, and few knew its location or even it purpose. Yet it was this small stone circle that enveloped the forest in Light and protected the elves who walked under its eaves from the dreaded Fading. The Wild Elves of Tragorian<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> are hardy, and they welcome other elves with open arms. They are battle hardened warriors and not very typical of forest elves really. The Wildness of Tragorian<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> has saturated their blood. They are in love with this land, and are autonomous with it.<br />
<br />
Tragorian<a href="" title="Create page: Tragorian"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is not widely known as a Sanctuary, but it is believed t be one of the strongest. Elves born there can go for greater lengths of time before they feel the pull of the Fading on their souls, if they venture away from Sanctuary. Some believe they are like the Water Elves, that because all trees are home to them, every forest is a Sanctuary…<br />
<br />

<br />
<a name='_b_The_Island_of_Time_b_'></a><h2><b>The Island of Time</b></h2>
<br />
The exact location of this island changes depending on the phases of the moon. Some believe this to be another resting place of one of the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> - which one is not known - this island is a safe haven for the sea-faring elves who are not blessed with the blood of the water alamia. It is said that when an elf is desperate for Sanctuary and is lost of stranded at sea, this island appears from the mist.<br />
<br />
Whether this is truth or fairy tales, we do not know. No elf has ever left the island, if it exists, therefore no account of this island has been made to those on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
The truth is it is surrounded by fog and if you are not an elf and happen upon this island, treacherous rocks shipwreck you if you get too close. It is dominated by a castle near the harbour. Behind the castle is a cascading waterfall which is the course of a river that flows past the eastern side of the ancient edifice. No mountain elf built this structure and no one on the outside knows who the builder is/was.<br />
<br />
Many legends surround this elven Sanctuary. Does the secret of this place lie with the elves or the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>? That is of course assuming there is even a <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> who dwells therein…<br />
<br />
Such is the mystery of this island perhaps we will never discover its secrets?<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Titan_s_Cove_b_'></a><h2><b>Titan’s Cove</b></h2>
<br />
This is the most accessible and famous of elf Sanctuaries, located in the tropical climes of the Merchants Belt. Not a traditional harbour, the Rock of Ages is the smooth stone cove, a narrow inlet in the centre allowing passage into the estuary.<br />
<br />
Natural lands bridges attach the sheer wall of the cove to the mainland; stretching across the estuary to reach the city and towns around the harbour. There are five of these that connect the cove wall to the bedrock of the mainland, and this is all part of the Rock of Ages. The largest exposed Rock in the world the Cove is a magnificent sight and an awe inspiring one.<br />
<br />
This place is dominated by elves that use it as their main trade centre outside of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. It is often visited by high councillors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Elf_High_Council_b_'></a><h1><b>The Elf High Council</b></h1>
<br />
Made up of two representatives from each alamia (type of elf). They always reside in Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and meet regularly in the dome of Inluar in <a title="Vidonia" href='Vidonia.html' class='wiki'>Vidonia</a> to discuss the Elves of the Nether Realm.<br />

<a name='_b_The_Fading_b_'></a><h1><b>The Fading</b></h1>
<br />
After the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> and the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> suffered their curse from the Darkness the elves were afflicted. It did not manifest in the first elves for almost a 1,000 years, long after the elves sundered into their alamia, going to where their hearts pulled them. The elves that loved the stone of the earth went into the mountains of the Nether Realm, the lovers of trees filled the forests, those cold of heart inhabited the Ice Continent, and those who loved the skies became the winged elves, evolving with the help of <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> and <a title="Terah" href='Terah.html' class='wiki'>Terah</a>...<br />
<br />
When the first millennia came to an end the curse reared its ugly head. Elves all over the Nether Realm began to fade; to literally become less corporeal. Losing their grip on the world they fled in hope to Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> where they found those that had stayed close to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, to his Rock of Ages had been protected from the curse. Those that had faded completely were lost, but those that made it in time regained their bodies but could not leave Elvenhome.<br />
<br />
At first it seemed that the <a title="Winged Elves" href='Winged+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Winged Elves</a> escaped this fate; but after the second millennia they too started to Fade. The only alamia to escape completely were the Water Elves. For them Elvenhome was not their only protection, the Oceans were home to them and sustained them. Only the land, oddly enough, could cause them to fade.<br />
<br />
Some accepted their fate and never returned to Elvenhome, but instead let the curse take them. They wandered the forests, the mountains and glaciers in their increasingly ethereal form, haunting the land they love so much, until the time came for the alumi to save them...<br />
<br />
Because Titan grieved at losing his children he extended his influence throughout the Nether Realm. Branches of the Rock of Ages emerged from the cold ground, creating safe havens for fading elves further away from Lenal. The branches of the Rock allowed fading elves to regenerate, and sustained them while away from Lenal. Only a seven safe havens are known, and these are called the Sanctuaries...<br />
<br />
But, alas, this is only temporary and the older an elf gets the more the need and desire to return to Lenal grows in their hearts. This is called The Yearning. The Sanctuaries are able to permanently sustain them.<br />
