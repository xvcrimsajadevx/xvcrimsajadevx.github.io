<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> All over Avalon<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Depends on the race of the member<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b> As this is a merc guild there is no uniform so to speak. these are soldiers for hire, the proceeds going to the guild and the members paid by the guild. The members can be from any country or race and therefore will have varied weapons, armour and clothes. All members have an armlet that identifies them as a member of the Guild.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
Loyal to the Guild only. These are the kind of mercs who want some kind of security and want to belong to something. They generally have no country they call home and are wanderers. Strong friendships are often formed within the Guild has they know if they stay with the Guild of Avalon they will never fight on opposite sides. Not the typical life of a merc, but a safer and more stable one.<br />
<br />
<b>History:</b><br />
<br />
The Guild was formed in Nyoryn after the fall of Gallian. The first members were made up of Gallian Warriors and soldiers who no longer had a country to fight for. It developed a reputation as an organised group of warriors and attracted contracts from all over the Nether Realm and members of all creeds, races, ages and talents. It is still going strongly today and still has its main base in the outlands of Nyoryn.<br />
<br />
MAGIC: Depends on the Guild Faction. some have battle mages, some have race specialist magic users. Magical armour and items are often bought by the Guild Leaders to improve their defence and attack.<br />
