<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview:</b></h1>
<br />
The land that saw the creation of the Great Alliance. A mysterious land that is rumoured to have been the location of the Temple of Orion<a href="" title="Create page: Temple+of+Orion"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Nsgarith<a href="" title="Create page: Nsgarith"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, the home of all <a title="Dwarves" href='Dwarves.html' class='wiki'>Dwarves</a> is in Eramor, as in one of the Sanctuary Stones of the Rock of Ages. The Dragon King's City is hidden in Eramors northern mountain range and the capital city of the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> is off the eastern coast of Eramor. The last great bastion of men outside of Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, Cendes, is also in this land.<br />
<br />
Once a United land, now only pockets of these races remain, their strongholds shutting out any other race.<br />
<br />
The fabled Gates of Orion are supposedly scattered throughout Eramor, but only the four races of the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> know their true locations.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_and_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns, cities and landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Cendes_b_'></a><h2><b>Cendes</b></h2>
<br />
The first settlers from Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> made this area upon which the city is built the first human outpost outside of their native land. Cendes is set upon a hill, the lower City built first. When the first Sentinel was elected a castle, built in the style of those in Avalon, was erected on the hill top overlooking what is now the Lower city. It now dominates the City skyline, the highest point on the plains surrounding Cendes. The City has no port anymore. Great earth movements long ago destroyed the first landing spots of the first settlers on Eramor and now the western edge of the city stops at the high cliffs. The castle and its grounds take up that coastline. A sheer drop to the rocks below awaits anyone trying to exit the city that way. It is rumoured that secret underground passageways lead from the castle to the caves below where there are small beaches, and, for those who know the water it is possible for small vessels to pick up passengers awaiting in the secrets coves.<br />
<br />
The city is in two parts. The Upper City; which is reserved for the wealthy - and the Lower City; where the normal patrons reside. The Lower City has one wide thoroughfare that leads from the main city gates in the outer perimeter wall to the castle. Narrow roads and backstreets wind through the lower city, their meandering routes dominating it. Alleys and cul-de-sacs spider from these cobbled streets, which are lined with a mixture of residential buildings, taverns and shops. Market stalls line most of the main streets and people pack them on most days.<br />
<br />
The Sentinel is the title bestowed upon the leader of the city-state of Cendes, and by extension, Cendes Port, or Port Town.<br />
<br />
First established in the year 570, the original Sentinal was little more than a military commandant of the merchant militia forces, who were bought and paid for by the protection tariffs of the merchants guild and trade unions of the local area. As such, they were a well-funded and well-trained military unit, and the Sentinel gathered much influence over the regional affairs. Surprisingly, even though a Sentinel enjoyed incredible amounts of influence over the local economy and politics, generally, it was never a position that was ever abused, because quite simply, if the Guilds were not satisfied by the local leadership or level of protection offered, they could quite simply cut their funding, or move their business away from Cendes. Therfore, there was a mutually beneficial, symbiotic relationship between the Sentinel and his militia and the Guilds.<br />
<br />
This would all drastically change after the failed assault upon the two cities of Reve and Reva in 3131E, which for a thousand years had been occupied by trolls. The Sentinel's forces walked into a trap, grossly underestimating their strength or proficiency in battle, and the Sentinel himself barely made it out of there alive.<br />
<br />
This incurred the wrath of the local troll communities, who, with unprecendented wisdom, pressed their advantage on the weakened forces of the the Cendes city-state. The Sentinel instituted rarely exercised powers of martial law and conscription, to better defend his jurisdiction and bolster his armies. This all came with Guild approval, of course, as there is always money to be made from such measures. While the Sentinel would never march upon Reve and Reva again, he did reclaim more territory for the city-state, established small puppet governments who quickly turned into vassal states, and after just five years of bloodshed, the Cendes was richer and more powerful than ever before. The elves of the Tragorian forests were instrumental in their military success, but the Sentinel ensured their economic success for years to come.<br />
<br />
However, across the span of the centuries, while the spread of human influence spread across Eramor, the actual position of Sentinel shifted from commandant of military forces to key administrator, governor and authorative figure. The position of Sentinal became a hereditary title, had many vassals who swear fealty to him, and quietly broke free of the financial funding of the Guilds. However, since the region was becoming an economic powerhouse in its own right, there was economic stability that the Guilds could rest upon and improve, if it so chose.<br />
<br />
The Sentinel, by the mid 4000s, was not so much a military commandant, but rather an earl. The Guilds were firmly under his influence, as they now found themselves bound to his economic policies, and were more obliged to pay the protection tariffs that paid for Cendes' military. This included the establishment of the Emissars; an elite military unit who initially made up the personal guard of the Sentinel, but soon were just an elite force of shock-troops and forward scouts who were fiercely loyal to the Sentinel.<br />
<br />
As the year turns slowly to the 6000s, Cendes is still a powerful and influential power in commerce in the region, but with a difference. It's influence on commercial matters has spread to Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and well across the Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Despite this, the territory held by the Sentinel is still terribly small, a small footprint upon Eramor. While this has served to support the status quo within Cendes, there are others who seek more.<br />
<br />
The current Sentinel is Lord Ivon Pardoner<a href="" title="Create page: Ivon+Pardoner"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, who is not only respected by his people but even liked as an able commander and an effective governor. However, his older half-brother is Guildmaster Bochan Menzes<a href="" title="Create page: Bochan+Menzes"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, has other plans. He seeks a return to the days of old when there was equal power and influence between the Guilds and the Sentinel, but if it was his choice, there would only be the Guildmaster in charge of the destiny of Cendes; and he would use it to further increase profits, no matter the human cost.<br />
<br />
In fact, his every move since becoming Guildmaster ten years ago has been solely dedicated to achieving this very end. Using his wealth and power, he has engineered dissent between the Guilds and the Sentinel rule, ensured there was an alienation between the populace and the true authorities, and has ensured that the public image of the Guilds is seen more favourably than the Sentinel.<br />
<br />
All he needs to do is convince a regional noble to seek to take the seat of power from the current Sentinel by force, and that will be all Menzes needs to justify the abolishment of the position, and incite public rebellion.<br />
<br />
However, all he needs to know is who to use as a puppet, and when the best time to make that move ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Cendes_Port_b_'></a><h3><b>Cendes Port</b></h3>
<br />
A few miles along the coast is Cendes’ official port, simply called, Port Town. These docks are where the Great Northern Trade officially starts. The town is simple in appearance. Wooden shacks line its docks and spread out and up the gentle incline, inland. As the main town peters out, the houses of the wealthy Merchants dominate and line the sides of the Trade Road. These are stone manors with great estates and have direct access to the Trade Road that leads south east to Cendes.<br />
The docks are numerous and the harbour can dock ships of all shapes and sizes. Many dwarven vessels dock here, stopping off before they sail onto either Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, or the dwarven harbours on the Ralan Delta. Few Azaili<a href="" title="Create page: Azaili"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> ships dock here any more and trade is carried out mainly between humans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Ford_of_Gulan_b_'></a><h2><b>The Ford of Gulan</b></h2>
<br />
This ford is the only place for hundreds of miles where the great Gulandril River can be crosses safely. Bridges up and down the river are hard to maintain as fell beast destroy them and attack those who try to cross them. As the river is shallow here and the current weak there is a sturdy bridge which the trade route uses so it can progress further north.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Thundering_Falls_b_'></a><h2><b>Thundering Falls</b></h2>
<br />
This is the prison of the great sea monster Leviathan and the only place inland where the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> are still seen. A rope bridges crosses the Fendurin River over the roaring Falls. Walking between the two mountains, known as the Fen Peaks, is treacherous, even on a clear day. The winding paths east of the river are stalked by rak-Shual and other fell beasts. There are safe caverns to shelter in from the snow at intervals along the path and once you are free of the high passes that exit the Falls the pleasant Plains of Ethos are a welcomed sight. Miles upon miles of flat green fields the views of the Fens snow capped peaks are beautiful from the Plains. West of the Falls the Azail offer more protection. The paths leading to the Gulan Delta safer and better kept.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Eladin_and_the_Emerald_Forest_b_'></a><h2><b>Eladin and the Emerald Forest</b></h2>
<br />
The secluded Sanctuary of the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> is in the centre of one of Eramor’s ancient forests. The Emerald Forest is vast and not all who enter it can count upon on the elves to save them from the evil creatures who dare to go beneath its canopy. The Elves of Eladin keep more to their Sanctuary and the outskirts of the forest on the western side have become very dangerous.<br />
<br />
The south eastern part of the forest is heavily guarded and patrolled. The Elven Harbour of Endärièl has a merchant path that goes through this part of the forest. This road supplies Eladin with goods from all over the world. The main road forks when it exits the forest, the southern path leading to ‘Orion’s Gate’. Three Alumi Tree’s stand in a triangle that is set within a smooth stone circle, on top of a hill that overlooks the ocean. The southern side of the hill ends with a cliff, the road ending at the bottom of the steep incline, about fifty feet north of the gate. From the Forest Gate there are awesome views of the southern ocean, blustery winds beating at the trees and the rain eroding the earth to expose the smooth, grey stone. The ring does not erode or look weathered.<br />
<br />
To the north there is a view of the forest, so green and vibrant. The distant ships in the harbour give this hill a terrific and awe inspiring panoramic aspect. This hill is also heavily guarded by the elves, the forest gate only a mile from the edges of the Emerald Forest and from the fork in the road.<br />
<br />
Eladin, known as ‘The White City’, its sheer and smooth walls rise high above the canopy of the surrounding forest, gleaming in the sunlight and at night emitting an effulgent glow. Inside the City walls there is a blend of forest and the white rock of the ancient city. Forest elf abodes are high in the canopy of the gnarled trees as well as settled between the enormous roots. The elves here dwell amidst rock and tree in harmony.<br />
<br />
The landmark and focus of the city is the beautiful, ivory castle of King Athros<a href="" title="Create page: Athros"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The former forest elf high councillor is the founder of Eladin and the protector of this Sanctuary. Eladin is a bright and beautiful jewel in the centre of the wild Emerald Forest and is built upon the bedrock of the Rock of Ages. The castle is unusual, some attributing this to it being carved from the Sanctuary Rock itself. The White Walls are also a part of the Sanctuary Rock, attached to the outer walls of the castle, the cities northern wall suffused into the back of the castle. The power of Titan surrounds and supports the city.<br />
<br />
When Athros<a href="" title="Create page: Athros"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> arrived he found only one jutting rock in the middle of a vacant grove in the dark and wild forest. No elf knows how the castle and city were built, as Athros came back to the ships and led his people to the City. Elf legends say that <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> himself carved out a castle for the forest elf and built the city around it. The castles interior is enchanted. Its passageways magically shifting, no corridor staying the same; it is vaster inside then it appears from the outside. Anyone who goes through the castle who is not of elven blood unaccompanied will be lost as only elves can change the inside of the castle to suits their needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_End_ri_l_b_'></a><h2><b>Endärièl</b></h2>
<br />
Surrounded by the Forest of Enda, and only five miles from the edges of the Emerald Forest, this Elven Harbour is hidden by the trees and only accessible via Eladin. Only elven boats dock here as its nautical location is hidden. It cannot be seen from the ocean and only elven captains and vessels can navigate to this port.<br />
<br />
Autonomous with the forest the town is small and the houses blending into the forest in true forest elf fashion. The docks are huge and the roads leading from them very wide. Its main purpose is supplying Eladin so only the dock workers tend to live in and around Endärièl.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Void_b_'></a><h2><b>The Void</b></h2>
<br />
On the edges of the <a title="Great Desert" href='Great+Desert.html' class='wiki'>Great Desert</a> is a solitary circle of mountains that from the outside look like a natural rock formation. They are actually hollowed out and inside is the remnant of an ancient tower, that is a mile wide and a thousand feet deep. This tower is a place of sacrifice, the bodies of the Chosen laid out upon the stone shelves that have been carved into the walls of the tower. In the depths is a lake of mist, a Void of despair.<br />
<br />
Long ago the <a title="Dwarves" href='Dwarves.html' class='wiki'>Dwarves</a> mined these mountains and they discovered this ancient tower and a stone seal at its base. Unable to read the runes upon it they broke through the stone floor and unveiled this Void. This was a gateway to the Demon Realm of <a title="Cheth" href='Cheth.html' class='wiki'>Cheth</a> and by unsealing it the dwarves released its evil into the world.<br />
<br />
The halls and mines that the dwarves made in the Encircling Mountains are now empty; their dwarven makers having abandoned the place after it started driving them mad. No dwarf has entered these cursed subterranean tunnels for thousands of years and no attempt has been made to seal the gateway again. Wyverns bring sacrifices from all over Eramor to feed the demons of Cheth who call from the Void. Their voices rise to the sacrificial ledges, pleading, coercing and teasing the damned, urging them to jump into the swirling, purple mist of the Vortex. ‘It is either jump or be eaten alive at noon by the Wyverns’ they tease, and the Wyverns perch and wait in their aeries at the top of the ancient tower, waiting for the sacrifice to make their choice…<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Great_Desert_and_the_Wilderness_b_'></a><h2><b>The Great Desert and the Wilderness</b></h2>
<br />
For some, this is where the Trade Route ends. Yet for others, such as <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a>, the hard pan desert is only the beginning. Way stations were built along the Desert Route long ago, and although they are now desert there are still pumps that draw water from the underground streams, shelter in the empty houses, and food stores that the wizards replenish in the cellars.<br />
<br />
The edges of the desert, on the borders of the Wilderness have some human colonies and outposts that manage to survive. There is no thriving out here, merely ‘getting by’. Most of these little communities are in the Wilderness of the north east of Eramor, the land supporting very small, self sufficient villages and hamlets who group together to protect themselves when under threat from the Wilderness Beasts. Mostly these villages are by a small river deep in the valley’s and too far away from each other to get into any fights. Life is too hard to argue with the neighbours anyway, so they tend to help each other where they can. Few farms can exist outside of these valleys, for like the lone traveller or unprotected merchant van, a small farm could not survive the constant attacks of the wild creatures who dominate the Eastern Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Eastern+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and the Wilderness’ of Eramor.<br />
<br />
Although Eramor has fewer of these beasts then say, the Wilds (due to Eramor being enclosed with the desert on one side, the oceans, mountains, Wastelands and marshes on the others), it is not possible for many humans to settle and have outposts outside of the protection of places like Cendes, Reve or Rava. Most outposts in the Wilderness are localised to the calmer lands in the north east or Eramor, where they have a better chance of survival.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Tirilian_Forest_b_'></a><h2><b>Tirilian Forest</b></h2>
<br />
By far the largest forest in this region, the most ancient and mostly unexplored; this vast forest is the home of faeries, pixies and nymphs. In the ancient tongue, ‘Tirilian’ means ‘enchanted’. Even the trees are alive here and they do not like intruders. The faeries dislike humans and serve the Forest Oracle<a href="" title="Create page: Forest+Oracle"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> who resides deep within this forest. Her Hollow is in the north, whereas the Faery Grove is in the south. In order to access the Nadoran Mountains (where the Stormbreaker Dragons reside) by land, one MUST pass through Tirilian, as it covers the foothills of this mountain range.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Padacan_Dales_b_'></a><h2><b>Padacan Dales</b></h2>
<br />
Few Unicorns<a href="" title="Create page: Unicorns"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> live in the valley anymore, as the shadow of the Void has polluted the land. Only the brave and strong choose to reside here. They stay because it is here that <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> made their race and marked it as hallowed ground, making it precious to the unicorns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Goblin_City_b_'></a><h2><b>Goblin City</b></h2>
<br />
This is a vast city that is burrowed into the roots of the Santillium Mountain range. The main entrance is near the spring of the Gashan River. The hovel of a shanty town lies within the black walls that were made using humans, their skeletons fossilised over time, a wall that marks the edge of Goblin Territory above ground. Few goblins live in the sunlight, and those who do are the most violent, stupid and despised, even amongst their own race. The city gate is similar to the entrance of a mine and upon the wooden beams are goblin runes engraved. They read;<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b>“In the Darkness, all are Lost.”</b></div><br />
<br />
Poorly dug tunnels run for hundreds of miles, a web of dank, dark and dirty dwellings, underground caverns, dungeons and a great amphitheatre the goblins call ‘The Anatshi’ which means ‘circle of death’. Here they have gladiatorial tournaments and feed their prisoners to the Chimera who dwells beneath the arena. Upon the orders of the goblin king, the floor opens up and reveals the Chimera’s den which the prisoner falls into.<br />
<br />
There are several exits from the city hidden high up in the mountains and in the foothills stretching east and west, and all the way north to Wyvern Peak.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Tragorian_Forest_b_'></a><h2><b>Tragorian Forest</b></h2>
<br />
Home of the Wild <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> of Eramor, they are the warriors who patrol the roads and keep the Wilderness as safe as possible. Tragorian stretches from the south west to the north east, its groves touching the very foothills of the Santillium Mountains. Tributaries to the Gashan River flow through the forest and the Gashan Delta provides rich and fertile land for the crops of the Wild Elves. The Trade Route crosses exactly thirty miles north of the forests borders, a smaller trade route running south from here along the southern border of the forest to the Azaili harbours that occupy the coast of Atlani Cove. Trade thrives between the <a title="Dwarves" href='Dwarves.html' class='wiki'>Dwarves</a> and the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a>, their merchants protected by Tragorian on this second Trade Route.<br />
<br />
<br />
The forest elf Finril was the cousin of King Athros<a href="" title="Create page: Athros"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> of Eladin, and a fellow high councillor for the forest elves on Lenal. He, along with Athros, left Elvenhome with a large contingent of forest elves, to explore the lands outside of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and discover a Sanctuary of their own. Once Athros had established Eladin, Finril decided to go further in Eramor and so he led his own people into the unknown to search for another Sanctuary that they could call home. Having battled trolls and goblins and all manner of feel beasts, he was about to turn back and return to the Sanctuary of his kinsman, when he found the Forest now called Tragorian. He searched under its eaves and came upon broken stone circle. Feeling its immense power he knew he had found a branch of the Rock of Ages. Its power emanated throughout the forest, blessing all who walked under its canopy.<br />
<br />
In the shadow of the Goblin Mountain Finril settled his people in the forest. His people flourished here, and became stronger, filled with the Light that Sanctuary blessed them with. They were on the frontier surrounded by dark races and fell beasts, but it was they who held them back, allowing the lands south of them to enjoy the freedom of Eramor without living in fear. They maintained and patrolled the highways and the trade routes, allowing merchants to cross Eramor in safety.<br />
<br />
No city did Finril build. The rock of ages was marked only by the broken stone circle he found deep in the forest. This was hallowed ground, and few knew its location or even it purpose. Yet it was this small stone circle that enveloped the forest in Light and protected the elves who walked under its eaves from the dreaded Fading. The Wild Elves of Tragorian are hardy, and they welcome other elves with open arms. They are battle hardened warriors and not very typical of forest elves really. The Wildness of Tragorian has saturated their blood. They are in love with this land, and are autonomous with it.<br />
<br />
Tragorian is not widely known as a Sanctuary, but it is believed t be one of the strongest. Elves born there can go for greater lengths of time before they feel the pull of the Fading on their souls, if they venture away from Sanctuary. Some believe they are like the Water Elves, that because all trees are home to them, every forest is a Sanctuary…<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Reve_and_Rava_b_'></a><h2><b>Reve and Rava</b></h2>
<br />
Twin fortified cites in the Borderlands, Reve is in the south west and Rava is in the north east; attached by a walled highway that runs between them. The Reevaa River flows between them also, a small river that branches off further north from the Ralan.<br />
<br />
These cities lie amidst a desolate landscape, the largest outposts outside of Cendes; they are run by merchants who have over the centuries created their own noble houses. Constantly attacked by trolls and goblins these cities rely on trade and the river trade supplies the city with food from farms in the south near the coast. A bland pair of cites, an overcast air and constant wet season their grey buildings and constant threat overshadow this human outpost.<br />
<br />
The people are mistrusting and rarely leave the city. The twin cities are surrounded by the boggy marshes of Tradal which emit a constant fog both day and night. This is a breeding ground for ghouls, it is very dangerous to go outside the city walls after dark or even travel the road between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Nsgarith_and_the_Dwarf_Mines_b_'></a><h2><b>Nsgarith and the Dwarf Mines</b></h2>
<br />
The mountain of fire is the birthplace of the dwarves and the heart of the dwarf nation. The city is built around and inside an active volcano. A volcano controlled by the dwarf king, who prays to <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a> to calm the heart of the mountain. The city has buildings, roads and farms in the rolling hills around it, and further towns and settlements in the surrounding mountains. Nsgarith is an immense city, far more sophisticated then the subterranean goblin city and far too hot for even mountain elves to live comfortably. Dwarven architecture almost rivals that of the mountain alamia, and they combined their might and magic to create the fortress of Nakra.<br />
<br />
Nsgarith’s cavernous halls have huge pillars that rise into the vaulted ceilings that have had the stalactites and stalagmites melted so that the ceilings and floors are smooth rock. The marble floors run through every room and every hall, the intricate and individual designs of the various parts of the city has the stamp of typical dwarven ingenuity and skill. Dwarven runes decorate the pillars whilst lush velvet carpets line the floor. The armouries are filled with mithril dwarven wrought armours and the blacksmiths fill the weaponries with an array of magical and normal weapons alike.<br />
<br />
The upper levels house the royal blood and higher blood of dwarves, but all are allowed to walk their halls. There is little ceremony and much work, even for royal blood. No one rests of their laurels in Nsgarith, not when trolls are on the doorstep.<br />
<br />
The mines are vast and well established. Coal, oil, gold, diamond, as well as all manner of jewels, and of course precious mithril. The mines stretch through all the mountains in the dwarven territories, all the way to Nakra.<br />
<br />
Fire Gate<br />
<br />
Orion’s Fire Gate is in a cavern beneath a secluded, solitary mountain on the edges of the Wastelands and the northern swamps. Dwarves guard it and trolls ignore it. To them it is of no worth, but the dwarves guard it nonetheless. It was trusted to their race aeons ago by the Light Bearer, and dwarves will ALWAYS fulfil their duty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dwarven_Harbours_b_'></a><h2><b>Dwarven Harbours</b></h2>
<br />
The Ralan Delta is heavily inhabited by the dwarves who harbour ships. This is their trade centre and any merchant who knows his worth will make regular trips here to barter deals. Dwarven goods are highly desired the world over, their magical items and weapons some of the best and numerous (mass produced) in the world.<br />
The Delta has hundreds of docks and is a constant hub of activity. The Bordersheilds defend the merchants and harbours which have regular attacks from trolls. The Trade Route has a road that branches south to take those who cannot go by river to the dwarven ships in the delta.<br />

<a name='_b_Nakra_b_'></a><h2><b>Nakra</b></h2>
<br />
Built by dwarves and mountain elves, this fort has changed rule between trolls and dwarves since it was first built. It is a hundred miles inside the Wastelands and is the last safe haven of the North Westerly Branch of the Great Trade Route. As with the route through the desert, it is mostly armies of dwarves and contingents of wizards who continue the journey north through the troll infested wastes. Nakra is suffused in a gloomy half light and always lit with Pyra’s Fire. When dwarves inhabit Nakra - as they currently do - Pyra’s Beacon tops the tallest tower like a flag it states that Nakra is theirs.<br />
<br />
An imposing city from the outside, its slate walls are high and thick. Its portcullis made of black iron and stained with the blood of those who have defended its walls. A city of angles, perpendicular edifices that reflect both elven and dwarven design. In the darkness the crystals in its walls glow, lighting the city like a star in the vast darkness. Only when the dwarves inhabit the city dot he crystals glow. The city is self sufficient, its vast stores stocked up to last for a hundred years of a siege.<br />
<br />
Bordersheilds maintain the city, but the Dwarf King Thain rules it. There is always a dwarf with Royal Blood who acts as governor of Nakra. Recently Dain IV died in the skirmish with trolls at the northern gate. The next governor of Nakra is likely to be Dain’s cousin.<br />

<a name='_b_Troll_Territory_Plains_of_Desolation_b_'></a><h2><b>Troll Territory (Plains of Desolation)</b></h2>
<br />
Most trolls live in caves or in the dry canyons in the Wastelands. The Plains of Desolation are a bereft land that most should not dare to cross. The safest passage to the coast is via the Ralan River, but even then boats have to be careful. The lagoon where the Hydra is imprisoned is still dangerous; even if the beast is sealed deep below on the lake bed, its dark influence has corrupted the waters it inhabits. Trolls patrol the shores and banks on the northern side, making light work and meals of those stranded on their Plains.<br />

<a name='_b_The_Wastelands_b_'></a><h2><b>The Wastelands</b></h2>
<br />
Desolate. Dead. Dried dust damning the despairing land, eroding the hard pan ground; the black rock of the crumbling canyons strangling all life...<br />
<br />
Only trolls and the dark creatures of the Wilds can survive these lands and only fools try to traverse them.<br />
