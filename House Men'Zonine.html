<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b> There is only one legitimate <a title="Men’Zonine" href="Men%E2%80%99Zonine.html" class="wiki">Men’Zonine</a> on the Forbidden Isles and that is Vahirga. Thankfully for her subjects, she is also the Matriarch of the Malevolent Bereave as well as one of the Twelve Generals and so her time is vastly consumed leading the obsidian elf armies. Her subjects live in fear when she is home, but go about their business as normally as possible when she’s not. There are few, if any, that have the courage to stand up to or plot against Vahirga.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b> Since the beginning for their time House <a title="Men’Zonine" href="Men%E2%80%99Zonine.html" class="wiki">Men’Zonine</a> has been part of the Malevolent Bereave. It started around 4000 years ago, during the war with the vampires. <a title="Szu’Zanin" href="Szu%E2%80%99Zanin.html" class="wiki">Szu’Zanin</a> <a title="Men’Zonine" href="Men%E2%80%99Zonine.html" class="wiki">Men’Zonine</a> had drawn the attention to herself through her impeccable ability to mow her way through enemies on the battlefield with her spiked chain. Because of her birth, she was a commoner at the time; <a title="Szu’Zanin" href="Szu%E2%80%99Zanin.html" class="wiki">Szu’Zanin</a> was constantly being put on the front lines as fodder for her enemy.<br />
<br />
Yet while comrade after comrade fell beside her, <a title="Szu’Zanin" href="Szu%E2%80%99Zanin.html" class="wiki">Szu’Zanin</a> managed to continue fighting with little to no injury. Eventually her commanders took note until at last she was sworn into the Ashen Guard, the personal bodyguards of the Clan Matriarch herself. While it was rare that someone of such low birth could rise through the ranks into such a respectable position, it was not unheard of. To secure her position, <a title="Szu’Zanin" href="Szu%E2%80%99Zanin.html" class="wiki">Szu’Zanin</a> married one of her fellow Ashen’s sons and became a Lower Noble.<br />
<br />
Over the years House <a title="Men’Zonine" href="Men%E2%80%99Zonine.html" class="wiki">Men’Zonine</a> slowly began to rise to the top till about 1000 years ago it finally became High Noble under the command of Vahirga’s grandmother. Its rise came to a stall under Vahirga’s mother, who had neither the intelligence nor the purpose to move its rank. Vahirga on the other hand is shrewd and calculating with more ambition then anyone before her and has managed to not only raise her House to one of the top ranking Houses in obsidian elf society, but also her Clan as one of the Twelve Generals.<br />
<br />
<b>EXTRA INFO:</b> There is, of course, one other legitimate <a title="Men’Zonine" href="Men%E2%80%99Zonine.html" class="wiki">Men’Zonine</a> out there, though as far as Striaath is concerned he has forsaken his right when he walked away from his sister 10 years ago.<br />
