<br />
<b>Name:</b> Teran A'ao<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> North East of Avalon<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns, cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Capital_Alaanzyr_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital - Alaanzyr</b></h2>
<br />
Situated along the Dhaa River, it is the only major city or town that is in the A'ao desert. In the south east of the desert and hundreds of miles due south of the Temple of <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. The city is a jewel in the desert. Its walls are made of Dhaa clay and built high to protect those who reside within against the fierce sandstorms. The city is stretched along the north and south banks of the river. the buildings are old but well looked after. The city is an ancient city and has stood for many generations. The Ashari Family have always resided in the palace here. It is not a huge palace but inside it is grand. Only the royal family lives there. The other noble houses reside in cities, forts and towns throughout Teran A'ao. The palace is identifiable by a white dome in the north of the city. A stream runs to the east of the palace, the little brook flowing to the river a few miles south. The city is large and spread over a few miles along the river, and about a mile either side. As they are in the desert life revolves around the river, which in all of Teran A'ao's history has never dried up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_A_ao_Desert_b_'></a><h2><b>A'ao Desert</b></h2>
<br />
The centre of the desert, where the high dunes, dry and hot climate dominates starts at the foot of the Gallian Mountains and stretches for hundreds of miles out from there. Most of Teran A'ao is desert, but not all of it the soft sand of the A'ao Desert. This desert is believed to be sacred, a holy land and the realm of <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. It is here that the people of Teran A'ao first pledged themselves to the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>. Only one river runs through this desert, which is a miracle in itself, a blessing of Eleph. Raiders tend not to go into the A'ao desert, but of late many foul things have encroached upon the Teran's holy land.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Temple_of_Eleph_b_'></a><h2><b>Temple of Eleph</b></h2>
<br />
Located in the east of the desert, the Temple of the <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> of Destiny is hard to find. Unless you are of Teran A'ao blood, it is impossible to find. Hidden by the sands of A'ao, <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a> and her Priests and Priestesses reside in the temple and assist those who visit them if they can. Sanctuary is given to all, but knowledge has to be earned. There are many a wanderer who has sought Eleph that has found the temple, but never returned to the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Mazh_Sharih_Fortress_b_'></a><h2><b>Mazh'Sharih Fortress</b></h2>
<br />
Situated on the northern frontier, this fortress is Teran A'ao base of military operations. The canyons of Mazh surround the fortress making it hard for any army to attack it. The canyons are believed to be haunted and the ghosts of dead Teran's rumoured to protect those who reside in the canyons and in the Fortress itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dhaashad_Springs_b_'></a><h2><b>Dhaashad Springs</b></h2>
<br />
The only place in this dry land that is abundant with water. Three rivers converge here and run down to the ocean. This is where much of Teran A'ao's crops are grown and many roads merge here. The other main crops are grown in the north of the country, on the borders of Sedana and Nyoryn, and near the one and only dock of the country.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Shariah_Docks_b_'></a><h2><b>Shariah Docks</b></h2>
<br />
This is where Teran trades. Most highways lead to Shariah and this is the only way into Teran A'ao via ship. River boats enter the country, but are not abundant due to Teran's rivers drying up during the very hot season. Shariah is therefore much cooler, being on the coast, and much more populated with a mixture of races and peoples. Merchants trade here and Teran's board vessels to Adenia and other humans outposts around the world. It is not the most sophisticated of docks, Teran's not being a sea worthy people, but it fulfills its function well enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Jogan_Imoel_b_'></a><h2><b>Jogan Imoel</b></h2>
<br />
The residence of Teran A'ao's Shah is within this region. The city of Jogan is in the very centre of the hardpan Imoel desert. A dry land, but one that supports a few crops and most of Teran A'ao's population. Other towns and villages exist in this region.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
Teran A'ao is a hot country with a people who mostly live on the borders of the A'ao Desert. Sand and sun shape the land, the huts of the people make the slums and the grand palaces gleam in the sunshine. Deeply influenced by magic and mystery they worship the Djinn of Destiny, <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. Mysticism is deeply entrenched in this peoples culture and the wisdom of the Shaman is sought after by all.<br />
<br />
The climate in this area is hot and dry and has very little rainfall; but the land in the area of the Dhaashad Springs is a fertile oasis due to the constant flow of water brought by the rivers. The main concentration of the population was in and around the region of Jogan Imoel. The Teranian's are for the most part farmers and warriors; the farmers using a complex system of irrigation between the two rivers to feed their crops. The water is strictly regulated to insure that the river resources are not wasted. Water is carried through earthen channels to the fields where it is used to water the plants. They grow mainly vegetables and grains which are transported throughout the Teran A'ao using the trade roads and rivers. At the Shariah Docks they trade the goods and textiles they make using the raw materials from the desert, the mountains and the canyons. Due to their complex irrigation systems and forms of ploughs, Teran A'ao is one of the most fertile areas despite it's location in the desert.<br />
<br />
Due to their lack of raw materials, the Teranian's had to develop new construction techniques for the construction of buildings. They developed sun dried clay bricks and this is what almost every building is made of. Because the clay could be found in a variety of colours or dyed to a variety of colours, the Teranians have many very interesting and very beautiful temples and public buildings. They are not only skilled in their construction of buildings but also in the layout and position of their buildings in the cities. All cities constructed by them are well built and aesthetically pleasing. The Teranians are also very skilled at arts and crafts, producing several well-crafted and beautiful artefacts that they often trade in Shariah with foreign merchants. The Teranians are an inventive and intelligent people who, due to their position in the desert were forced to make large advances in the techniques of agriculture and due to their faith and beliefs and the benevolence of <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a> they are a very spiritual and wise people.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_People_of_Teran_A_ao_b_'></a><h1><b>The People of Teran A'ao:</b></h1>
<br />
There are many variations within this country, but everyone revolves their lives around the desert. As the deserts are so huge there are many nomadic tribes that are not even numbered or listed by the authorities. They have their own beliefs and laws even. A plague of Raider's troubles Teran's wilds, and it is advised that travellers a wary upon the road. Other tribes, such as the Tol Kyn, are seeped in mystery - to those in the cities and on the farms they are a legend and a whisper on the wind.<br />
<br />
The farmers and warriors of Teran make up the bulk of the population. The nobles and the Sheik ruling over the various regions. These people are the belly dancers, the tradesmen, the farmers, the medicine men and exotic flavour of the land. They are the majority and live mostly in the towns and cities, as close to water as possible.<br />
<br />
Then there are the Shaman, and the servants of <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. These people are the chosen ones, the wise ones of Teran A'ao. They come from all walks of life and live a life of dedication, spirituality, reflection and learning. They live in their own communities in the desert and the mountains. Those who are called to reside with the people are the pillars of the community, the healers and the Wise One's.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
The Sheik Kalil Ashari<a href="" title="Create page: Kalil+Ashari"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is the political and religious leader. He always wears a mask (a dragons head). He has twin children, a son and a daughter. His son <a title="Jahad Ashari" href='Jahad+Ashari.html' class='wiki'>Jahad Ashari</a> is his heir - his daughter <a title="Isdrae Ashari" href='Isdrae+Ashari.html' class='wiki'>Isdrae Ashari</a> is actually not a twin but an adopted daughter. She was born the same day as his son and found on the alter in the Temple of <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. She has grown up to be a summoner.<br />
<br />
The Sheiks Council consist of several noblemen, shamans, priests and other influential and important people in Teran A'ao. They give him council and cannot dictate to him what he must do. Most are faithful to him even if they do not always agree with him.<br />
<br />
The Shah is the chief advisor of the Sheik and often carries out the Sheiks orders and makes sure they are implemented throughout the country.<br />
Religion and Culture:<br />
<br />
Teran A'ao worships the Djinn of Destiny, <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a>. There culture is heavily influenced by this, their most wise individuals the Shaman and the Servants of Eleph. They have a high place in society and are considered holy by their people. Mysticism and magic are a central part of their culture, and those who possess the ether ability are raised up as special individuals. They never send people to the Wizarding Isles as they believe the knowledge of the Shaman is greater then the Wizards and a better path to take.<br />
<br />
Their festivals all revolve around the stars, they put great faith in their astronomy and their fortune telling. Their potions are potent and the healing of their Shaman the some of the most effective in the Nether Realm. The people of Teran A'ao pray to Eleph several times a day and all give tribute to her at the shrines that are located in the Oasis's outside of every town, village or city, and deep in deserts to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
Everything is judged by the Priests of Eleph. There are laws in which the final judgement is made by the one offended (the victim). It is a very fair system and very few break the law because of it.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
The Teran will only trade with merchants at the Shariah Docks, and then only with Adenian's and Fenlari's mostly. The Azaili rarely travel to Teran A'ao but when they do the Teran's trade excessively with them.. This is a long standing alliance.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
Shaman’s are as powerful as wizards, but are considered by the Wizards as un-trained. They are of course trained by the existing Shaman, and therefore consider themselves more trained then the arrogant wizards. They are monk like, and very zen, and are very respected in Teran A’ao. Shaman’s are the magic user’s of Teran, they specialise in;<br />
<br />
Pyromancy<br />
Mind Magic<br />
Time Magic<br />
Eleph’s magic.<br />
<br />
They work with the Priests and Priestesses of Eleph. There is complete autonomy with those that serve in the temple and the Shaman. They are the corner stones of any village or Teran society and seen as the most wise and powerful of magic users by their own people. The servants of Eleph (the priests and priestesses) are powerful and they have special abilities given to them. They do not have to be born with the Ether ability in order to serve in the temple.<br />
<br />
The Shamans on the other hand are all inherently magical and teach each other the mysteries of their society. They often mediate alone in the desert and live alone in the societies throughout Teran A'ao, giving healing and wisdom to those who seek it. Those who train as Shamans (both male and female, all are equal in Teran A'ao) go into the A'ao desert where they are met by the Order of Shaman and are tested both spiritually and physically. Although they do not serve <a title="Eleph" href='Eleph.html' class='wiki'>Eleph</a> directly, they do worship her. They are above the temple servants, and seen by Eleph as a law unto themselves. Because they respect and worship her she grants them the freedom of their magics and personally taught the first of them powerful spells that have been handed down through the Order with each new generation of Shaman.<br />
<br />
Mysticism and foresight, time and explosive fire magics their strengths. Their weaknesses could be considered their refusal to share their knowledge with anyone they do not deem worthy. Also their refusal to entertain wizards, as they do not respect most of them and see them as foolish and arrogant.<br />
