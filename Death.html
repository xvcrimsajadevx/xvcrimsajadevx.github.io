<br />
Death in the Nether Realm varies and is the domain on the Darkness. Death is its curse to the races of the Light. The life spans of the races vary, but the general rules of death are very much the same. Each race and religion may have their own beliefs about the afterlife and rebirth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Oblivion_b_'></a><h1><b>Oblivion</b></h1>
<br />
Human souls go to <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> (the Realm of Death) when they die and are escorted there by the <a title="Ferryman" href='Ferryman.html' class='wiki'>Ferryman</a>. This realm is one of the Other Worlds and was created at the dawn of time by the Primal Power known as the Darkness. When humans were created the Darkness got jealous and cursed them with Death. This curse manifests itself in all other races, but only the first born of each Origin were wholly protected by it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Races_of_Darkness_b_'></a><h1><b>The Races of Darkness</b></h1>
<br />
These races were made to deliver death but they also suffer it. Their souls also enter <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> but this does not matter. There existence strengthens that world and they await it impatiently and eagerly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Curses_b_'></a><h1><b>The Curses</b></h1>
<br />
<a title="Humans" href='Humans.html' class='wiki'>Humans</a>, on average, live to around threescore and ten (70 years of age). Before the curse they were immortal. Only those humans who possess the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> ability and the <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> have a semblance of immortality now. Their bodies decay and rot, and their souls are ensnared by the Darkness upon death, and are doomed to spend eternity in Oblivion or be lost of the zephyrs of the spectral wind. The <a title="Ferryman" href='Ferryman.html' class='wiki'>Ferryman</a> does not wish this fate so he escorts hume souls into the River of Souls in <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>, there they must spend eternity and suffer the taint of the Other World and the Darkness. The Darkness could not initially destroy hume souls and the Light within them so it stored them here. That was until Apollyon corrupted his purpose and instilled the taint upon them, caused the souls in the river to slowly darken and transform, every day losing a little more of what they once were, losing their Light and humanity.<br />
<br />
All races of the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> as well as humans were doomed to be ensnared by <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> when they die. All races can be killed by war, injury, and mortal wounds and therefore none have true immortality. The <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> are exempt from the threat of <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> because of Titan's Alumi Tree. All of the First Born have significantly longer lifespans then the rest of the races as they were protected the most from the full effects of the Curse of Death, and so also the Dragons, Dwarves and Azail have places prepared for them and their dead souls, places of rest and protection made by their origin creator.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Dwindling_b_'></a><h1><b>The Dwindling</b></h1>
The Curse of the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> is known as <i>The Dwindling</i>. They suffer a form of infertility that has for several thousand years caused the Kindreds of <a title="Nado" href='Nado.html' class='wiki'>Nado</a> to Dwindle and fade forever from this world. The new Birthing has brought some hope to <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a>, but the Sterility still remains for those who do not adhere to the Birthing Rites.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Hecatomb_b_'></a><h1><b>The Hecatomb</b></h1>
The <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> Curse of Death is known as the <i>Hecatomb</i>. This curse threatens the <a title="Azail" href='Azail.html' class='wiki'>Azail</a> with complete annihilation. If but one member of their race remains permanently upon the land, theie entire race becomes ill with an incurable disease and they die.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Fading_b_'></a><h1><b>The Fading</b></h1>
The Elven Curse is called <i>the Fading</i>. For all <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> over the age of 1,000 the Fading will claim them unless they live upon the land which <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> created for them. The souls of the elves are saved from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. When <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> Fade their souls are integrated into the Alumi Tree, and they replenish the earth and strengthen it. In the ancient myths of the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> many believe that their magic is more proficient then that of other races of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> because the souls of the Alumi Tree strengthen them. An elf can live for eternity if they are not killed by unnatural means (war, injury, etc) and if they remain in a Sanctuary or upon Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, which is Elvenhome.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Dwarf_s_Bane_b_'></a><h1><b>Dwarf's Bane</b></h1>
<a title="Dwarves" href='Dwarves.html' class='wiki'>Dwarves</a> suffer the greatest blow of the curse as Pyra did not protect them on time. He was arrogant and did not believe his creations would be sullied by the Darkness, and so their lifespans are significantly shorter then those of the other three Firstborns. <i>Dwarf's Bane</i> is what they call it, and only the Phoenix and the Mountain of Fire protects them from this awful curse. Dwarves have always had the Wander Lust and so many more die then perhaps would if they stayed close to the Phoenix upon the Mountain. Every 800-1,000 years the Phoenix Moults and the protection it gives falls. Born again from the ashes it takes a few decades to gain its full strength again, and in this time any dwarf over the age of 500 who is away from Pyra's Mountain (Nsgarith) contracts Dwarf's Bane. This illness is fatal and cannot be cured. They die in extreme pain and live with it for many more years. Most dwarves accept this curse rather then deny the Wander Lust that is innate.<br />
<br />
All the other races of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> have shortened life spans compared to the First. Death takes them all and if their Origin does not take them then they too are doomed to be ensnared by <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> upon Death.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Rebirth_and_Reincarnation_b_'></a><h1><b>Rebirth and Reincarnation</b></h1>
<br />
There are other races not of the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a> that have mastered rebirth and avoid <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. These races are not born of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, but of the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. The <a title="Necra" href='Necra.html' class='wiki'>Necra</a> and the <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> both avoid <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>but in very different ways.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> are protected by The Seal Of Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Behind this seal is Paradise where Vigilian souls reside until it is time for them to be reborn. When this time come Ta'ko<a href="" title="Create page: Ta%27ko"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> escorts them to their new mortal body and the process of reincarnation is completed.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Necra" href='Necra.html' class='wiki'>Necra</a> were created by <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>, Lord of the Underworld, and they are taken to the City of the Dead. The souls remain close to their bodies until they have arrived and inside the City the Keepers tear their souls from their bodies, consume the flesh and then place their souls into a vial. When a new child is born the Keepers turn invisible and place the soul of the <a title="Necra" href='Necra.html' class='wiki'>Necra</a> into the newborn child upon the time of birth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Quasi_b_'></a><h1><b>The Quasi</b></h1>
<br />
The <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> souls are bound by Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and upon death they are taken by him to Paradise. This infuriates <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> as they are human souls, filled with <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> and need to be consumed by <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> protects the seal and so <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> cannot touch the souls beyond. The <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> are not reborn, but their souls go to Paradise and are protected from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> by the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and his Seal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Immortality_of_Wizards_b_'></a><h1><b>The Immortality of Wizards</b></h1>
<br />
As with all who can use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>, wizards can control their ageing. They can stop it whenever they like, looking like a ten year old for thousands of years, or looking like a seventy year old for thousands of years. Depending on when a child is taken to the wizarding isles will determine how soon they can do this, as it is something taught only on the isles. The look of ageing is just that. They appear to be a certain age. The <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> sustains the body and the soul grows old and tired, they develop the Yearning.<br />
<br />
They can be killed, that is what makes them mortal. The <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> prolongs their life, but the average age for a wizard to develop the Yearning is not known. When wizards get to an age when they are tired of the world they simply disappear. Very similar to the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> curse of the Fading. They tire of the world, and simply give up the ghost. They don't want to go to <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>, but such is the fate of men's souls. Everyone gets tired of life eventually, and their version of the curse is that they give up, and give in to the Yearning. Wizards like <a title="Arcemedes" href='Arcemedes.html' class='wiki'>Arcemedes</a> have a purpose, and stay active, whereas some find somewhere to die, and restart the ageing process.<br />
<br />
Before they allow themselves to grow old and die in a little village somewhere, they seek out the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> and Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. A spell is performed, the Sealing Spell, which enables the wizards soul to be taken by Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> when the wizard reaches the end...<br />
<br />
Once the ageing process has devoured their bodies, when they reach death they will look old, like any human would, they do not take on the years they have lived. They die a natural death and let go of the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. Moriqueeta<a href="" title="Create page: Moriqueeta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> takes their soul and seals it away so it cannot be taken to <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. Like the souls of the Summoners, they cannot be raised or taken by Necromancy, and are protected from <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Undead_b_'></a><h1><b>Undead</b></h1>
<br />
The races of the Undead do not all have eternal lives. They can be killed, and the Lamia live for only a thousand years, but some are reborn and some populate <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. The Aluka are all reborn and live sentiently for a time in <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. It is they who torture the souls of the dead, and they who know all aspects of the World of the Dead. Even <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> does not know all of its secrets, but the Aluka do. For a human to turn undead they must resurrect themselves and this is nigh impossible. Only the Aluka keep their memories of their past life, they are the ONLY race that do. The <a title="Vigilia" href='Vigilia.html' class='wiki'>Vigilia</a> may have some fleeting memories but they are not important. No one remembers paradise, and no one remembers <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>, except the Aluka.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Resurrection_b_'></a><h1><b>Resurrection</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
There are various types of resurrection, but for now we will not concern ourselves with the gods.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Wizards_b_'></a><h2><b>Wizards</b></h2>
<br />
Recalling a departed soul from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> requires immense skill, concentration and experience. There are very few adept in this spell. The longer the soul has been in <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> the harder it is to resurrect them. Wizards of Divination and Healing are able to heal the body once the soul has been recovered. It is the cleansing of the soul from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> and locating that soul that is nigh impossible. The longer a soul resides in the River of Souls the more tarnished it becomes. The <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> is overshadowed and poisoned by the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and the soul becomes corrupt. Divining where the soul is located is the biggest challenge. Wizards invoke, they call and they open a portal to the underworld and search with their mind. Once a soul is located and drawn forth it is cleansed by the wizards majicks. These souls are restored whole to a body that may or may not be theirs, but whole and untarnished.<br />
<br />
<a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> does not like a wizard taking souls from his realm making the spell even more precarious for wizards. Few are able to complete this spell when the soul is depart for longer the 24 hours. When it has been years since the soul has departed it is almost impossible. In these cases even the most powerful Diviners ask <a title="Ezia" href='Ezia.html' class='wiki'>Ezia</a> for help. She is the one who taught The Cleansing and is a sworn enemy of <a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a>. Only one wizard has ever raised a soul a thousand years departed and it is believed to be the current Leader of Divination who achieved this.<br />
<br />
However Wizards are aided in this endeavour by the <a title="Ferryman" href='Ferryman.html' class='wiki'>Ferryman</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Sorcerers_b_'></a><h2><b>Sorcerers</b></h2>
<br />
<a title="Apollyon" href='Apollyon.html' class='wiki'>Apollyon</a> allows their incursions, and so they are free to roam <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a>. They astral project themselves into this world and reach into the river and grab the soul of their choice. Sometimes it is a specific soul for a specific malcontent reason, but more often then not it is random as necromancers are by their very nature cruel and do things out of pure sadism. They tear this soul from the River of Souls with their own hands (their necromancy protecting them from being drawn into the river, but it has been known for weaker necromancers to be lost there forever) and place them uncleansed into a body that may or may not be whole. They animate the body using necromancy and have no need for the most part to heal the body. Necromantic zombies are often sentient (but have no memory of Oblivion) and abhor the body that has been forced upon them. The tearing from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> often results in the soul becoming insane and the tarnish of the Underworld insures obedience and loyalty to the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and to the necromancer who raised them. They are tainted and corrupt, unclean, not whole and undead. They do not live in the way others live, they rely wholly upon the necromancy from which they were raised.<br />
<br />
The <a title="Ferryman" href='Ferryman.html' class='wiki'>Ferryman</a> hates necromancy and if he sees a necromancer in his realm he will try to stop them taking souls.<br />
<br />
<br />
To return unaided from <a title="Oblivion" href='Oblivion.html' class='wiki'>Oblivion</a> is impossible. To return whole is almost impossible, memory will be lost, parts of the soul may be lost, even for the most adept of wizards complete success is not guaranteed and rarely accomplished. Resurrection is not a magic often used by wizards because of the dangers to the spell caster and to the soul.<br />
