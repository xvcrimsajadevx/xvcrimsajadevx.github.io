There are many nomadic tribes and clans that do not belong to a country, as well as organised groups that may be military, mercenary or religious, and sub species of the existing races that have particular groups and tribes and clans. If you create a character that is part of an original group such as these, it may be useful to fill in this info sheet, so we can add it to the <a title="Subcultures" href='Subcultures.html' class='wiki'>Subcultures</a>.<br />

For members who wish to add their own Noble House to this world they must submit this completed form to the Profile Applications forum in the Character Creation Centre. All types of nobles houses use this template, all races and cultures must use this template and submit it completed to the profile application forum. Please state in the topic description that it is a noble house application and which race or country it is for. Thank you.<br />
<br />
<b>PLEASE NOTE</b> The <a title="Avalon Noble Houses and Royal Family Tree's" href='Avalon+Noble+Houses+and+Royal+Family+Tree%27s.html' class='wiki'>Avalon Noble Houses and Royal Family Tree's</a> that contain the most powerful and prominent houses MUST be taken into account when you make your own house. As they are currently under construction and few canon houses have been officially added at this point in time it will be very easy to get your noble house accepted.<br />
<br />
You only have to complete the House Info if you wish to add your noble house to the History of Avalon. If there is a significant addition to the History of Avalon then please point it out and make sure you let a staff member know if a new profile contradicts your info. We are not perfect and forget some of the stuff we add, let alone the vast amounts members add.<br />
<br />
YOU MUST FILL IN THIS TEMPLATE AND HAVE IT ACCEPTED BEFORE YOUR AVALON NOBLE HOUSE IS ADDED, WE ARE MORE PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS KIND OF APPLICATION AS THE HISTORY OF OTHER MEMBERS HOUSES AND THE CANON HISTORY MAY BE EFFECTED. UNLIKE THE SUBCULTURE APPLICATION THIS IS MANDATORY.<br />
