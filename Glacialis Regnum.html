<br />
The ice city is the jewel in the ice continent. It is huge and is the home of most of the humans on this desolate and cold continent. Ice palaces and clean streets decorate the Kings Sector. The slums are not atypical, not reminiscent of somewhere like Eraosia for instance. Here the poor are left to freeze, and the spidery roads that make up the labyrinth of the outer sector support the beggars and the commoners alike. The taverns are crammed beside the residential buildings and shops, the snow coating the streets all year around, and the cobblestones never being seen in this part of the city.<br />
<br />
The Kings Sector is palatial, open and somehow warmer then the rest of this huge city. The sector is cut off from the rest of the city by a white wall, the only entrances heavily guarded and only royal visitors and nobles allowed to enter (as well as servants and soldiers). The palace of Annais<a href="" title="Create page: Annais"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is the work of the best human masons in the world, and finished off by the light bearer's himself. Pristine white and glaring in the sunlight, whiter then the snow itself and glowing with inner light and magnificence, this building has not dulled in the centuries it had stood.<br />
<br />
The city has no wall around it and the slums have spread to the edges of the Glacius Regnum. Smaller towns and villages are scattered over the wastes, but few decide to live too far from the city. The safety of the wall does not protect them from the elves. The roads of this region are maintained by the elves also, and the main trade route runs through Ardra. There are mountainous regions and many wastes and but one flowing river. This runs through the main gate and one assumes that the grace of Annais keeps it flowing. Boats are able to sail it, and come in from the coast directly into the inner sanctum of the Vallumglacier.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The Vallumglacier has one main entrance for humes, that is directly north of the Glacius Regnum. This is a thick wall of clear ice that with the edict of the King, Annais, one can pass through magically. As you pass through the wall you can feel a cold sensation briefly before exiting on the other side. This is the only place all races (other then the Ice Elves) can enter or exit. As the <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a> built the ice wall they made other exits that only elves could use. These are dotted all along the Vallumglacier and can only be detected by elves. They are smaller version of the 1/2 mile wide Ice Gate. This is why the ice elves can come and go as they please. As Annais mistrusts the magic of the elves and believes that the mountain elves magic on the wall would allow <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> to enter whenever they wanted, he placed his own enchantments upon the wall, thus only letting <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> have the freedom that all <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a> once enjoyed.<br />
<br />
As the years have gone by the King has gotten more paranoid, gradually making the laws of his land more strict and dictorial, slowly crushing all freedom from his people. The Laws on the Wall has changed the most in the last 50 years, the King allowing in more unsavoury types then in the previous generations.<br />
<br />
Currently to leave or enter the Vallumglacier one must have written permission, signed and sealed by Annais. This may sound like he would be constantly writing the edicts to hand out to people as the place is huge so even a small number of people leaving would be a huge amount; but as Annais<a href="" title="Create page: Annais"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is a Light Bearer<a href="" title="Create page: Light+Bearer"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and his magic it beyond that of anyone in the world these papers are easy for him to conjure and he is able to personally see to every request.<br />
<br />
No one can leave without permission. The King does not need permission and his coming and going is not regulated by anyone. He somehow, mysteriously manages to regulate every single person who enters the Wall and exits it. He is all knowing and all powerful in the Ice Kingdom of Humes.<br />
<br />
People are regularly shipped off to the <a title="Wizarding Isles" href='Wizarding+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Wizarding Isles</a> as for a long time Annais had a strong affiliation with the wizards and believes all ether users should be taught there. His paranoia also extends to the wizards now though, but this does not stop him sending people there, it does however stop them from coming back. Annais does not let many wizards into his realm, and those that do manage to get in get in without declaring themselves as magical.<br />

<br />
Annais rules all. His word is law and none challenge him. He is a light bearer, one of the chosen, and as close to a god in the flesh as many are likely to see. He is untouchable and he runs every part of the Glacias Regnum personally. He used to have close contact with the wizards, but in recent times has had a penchant for ice elf company.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
The cultures and religions of Avalon thrive here. The main source of worship is of course Annais and the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>, but small contingents of <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> worshippers litter the society of humes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
<ul><li> No one passes the Vallumglacier without permission of the King.
</li><li> No murder
</li><li> No affiliations with dark minions.
</li><li> No wizards.
</li><li> No crime whatsoever, punishments are given out by Annais himself. He is judge and jury.
</li></ul>
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
Trade comes via the River Tria, and mainly from Avalon.<br />
