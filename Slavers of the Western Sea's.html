The main ship in the fleet is called the Cutlass and the Captain is Ganray Zanziba, a ruthless and notorious slaver who trades between the Necra and Sedanian's on a regular basis.

Many of the crew on any of this fleets slaver vessels will rape the women and torture the men, tossing an new born babies over board as little money can be got for a babe.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
      A light two-masted lateen-rigged vessel, and because of its smaller size the Salamander is able to explore upriver in shallow coastal waters. With the lateen sails affixed, it is able to go speedily over shallow water and take deep wind. As the caravel is very fast it is able to outrun most ships.<br />
