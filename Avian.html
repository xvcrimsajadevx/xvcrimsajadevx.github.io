<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> For the most part they live amongst <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a> though those that actually keep their wings will travel to more isolated areas on the outskirts of societies. There are also groups known to live amongst wooded areas keeping out of sight.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Average human life-span, 70-80 years with some living longer other shorter.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
They are often said to appear half human, half bird, though one might argue their bone structure in a way, is closer to a bat, but it does tend to have 'bird' features mixed in. All in all they are strange looking ‘creatures’.<br />
<br />
Avians are a naturally small and thin race built/designed for flight they rarely grow to be any taller then five foot nothing (including the males). On a rare occurrence males can grow to be five foot two but they will rarely grow any taller then that and when they do it usually do to mixed blood. Weight wise they usually weigh in at seventy-five pounds give or take, this though light is perfectly healthy for them. With out their wings and if they keep on eating the normal diet of an avian who still has wings it not unheard of for them to gain weight becoming ‘heavy’ this is do to the build up of fat instead of the burning of it.<br />
<br />
They have the same hair colors as humans though unlike humans they can have some interesting mixes such as dark brown and light brown, brown and black, and even odder mixes such as blond and brown, or even auburn and brown. Their feathers are the same color as their hair, so if they have the mixed hair color their wings will be two colored as well. their primary feathers will always be lighter colored then the secondary feathers.<br />
<br />
Their eye (unlike their hair) is unique and eye color can usually distinguish an avian from a human even if the avian is wingless. They gained the eye color of the birds, gold seems to be the most common color found (like brown in humans), with true black that almost beady in appearance (think raven). There has been a few cases of full-blooded Avians being born with red eyes, golden-brown/golden black, and even a few cases of them being born with what many would refer to as ‘true yellow’ which is just a lighter color then the gold. The rarest for them is brown and soft brown is not a common Avian color. As for the common human colors (blue and green for example) there has never been a case of a full-blooded Avian being born with them and it thought to be impossible. A few cases of half-breed/part-breeds having these colors have been reported.<br />
<br />
Their wings tend to be about two to three times their height (making them anywhere from ten to fifteen and half feet. The feathers of the secondary feathers line the bottom of the wings, and skin can usually be seen through them. the feathers sit nestled tightly against each other, and this forms an airtight seal, which is helpful when in flight.<br />
<br />
They also have feathers mixed in with their hair, and down the back of their necks, and down their legs. They also have feathers mixed in anywhere there is hair, so this includes body hair too.<br />
<br />
They have a larger breastbone then the average human with thicker bone, this works as a sort of anchor for the muscles that re used during flight.<br />
<br />
Their ribs, as with the breastbone, are larger in circumference and are about two times as ‘deep’ as a normal human’s. This to is a type of aid for muscle though it also accommodates the slight difference in their ‘organs’.<br />
<br />
The larger ribs and breastbone when working together tends to give the impression that the Avian’s have a larger chest (even the males) do the extra circumference all around, that said the species as a whole is rather ‘flat-chested’ (even the females). Though they are mammals (in reproduction sense at least) therefore do ‘nurse their offspring’ breast are made up of mainly fat therefore they would add weight which is something that would hinder flight.<br />
<br />
Though an Avian and human are often described as the same species there is a noticeable difference between the way the two look and despite the similarities Avian’s are noticeably unique. Their arms though muscled and joined like a humans are overall longer with shorter forearms. Their legs are shorter and stockier, containing not only more muscle but more fat as well. the fat acts as a type of insulator absorbing the shock of landing. Feathers run up the back of the legs adding more surface area, these feathers act as a type of rudder aiding the Avian with steering during flight. This lessons though doesn’t eliminate the problem the human body has (they are bottom heavy).<br />
<br />
Their fingers are elongated; this like with the feathers on the back of their legs adds more surface area as well as helping with the steering. An extra finger (sixth finger if you will) comes from their wrist, the finger is joined much like a bird’s wing, with ‘three joints (Counting the joint from the wrist)’ and is long accounting for the full wingspan. The digits folds in a sort of ‘accordion’ style folding in on itself and holds against the length of the arm. This bone is thing and fragile and awkward, in a way This bone can easily be broken or shattered during flight if the individual is not careful where it is going and bangs into something. it also a good target in a fight.<br />
<br />
<a class="wiki"  href="http://www.wfu.edu/biology/albatross/images/anatomyblank.jpg">http://www.wfu.edu/biology/albatross/images/anatomyblank.jpg</a> (bird wing)<br />
<br />
Their fingers are also cloaked in feathers to the last joint of their joints, adding as much surface area s possible without removing use of the hand. Their ring and pinkie finger are partially fused as are their toes (all their toes are slightly webbed) this too adds to the surface area and aids in steering. The adaptations like the feathers of the back of their lets act as a rudder and aids in steering, acting in place of a tail, which is what helps a bird.<br />
<br />
Though maybe what the most ‘unique’ thing about them has to be their wings, though there are other winged creatures (some are even humanoid) their wings standout. While the other species wings come from the back as two extra limbs their connect to the arms (in a way eliminating the awkwardness of trying to control two extra limbs). This though comes with its own set of issues, since the arm controls the wings lifting the arm will often cause half the wings to flair open (and the other half tends to hang down along it). Though the extra finger controls the other half and that part will only open if one extends the extra finger this also has it flaws. The fact that the wings are sectioned off as they are makes them a somewhat flimsy design allowing them to collapse if too much damage is done to them.<br />
<br />
They have the ability to lock the joints in their arm and finger for the most part this allows the wings to remain open though during flight. Their wing structure when in use is much like a glider.<br />
<br />
<a class="wiki"  href="http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/birds/ohio...ters_tern_a.JPG">http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/birds/ohio...ters_tern_a.JPG</a> (glider bird)<br />
<br />
If the wings are removed and as long as it done early enough the body’s proportions will right themselves out. No one is exactly sure how this happens but it always does. The operation to remove them will leave behind long pearly marks along the arms where the wings once attached to the arm. The scars are clean and relatively smooth though, as they come from a sort of carving motion (like one would carve a turkey) as the wings are almost literally carved off.<br />
<br />
Clothes wise they where nothing special, though there is a good chance that if they were allowed they would go naked to prevent anything getting in the way of the feathers, wings, etc. Shirts are hard on them though since the wings attack to the arms getting the shirts on is difficult. They often need shirts that can tie on or something really baggy to fit over the wings. Most (males at least) often choose to go without shirts. Shoes too for whatever reason seem to be bothersome.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
Do to their soft and gentle natures the Avians are usually referred to as being ‘creatures of light/good’. Most tend to be pacifists rejecting any type of violence other then what is needed for simple survival. Unfortunately, though they all seem to agree on the idea that ‘unnecessary violence’ is ‘unacceptable’, there is no consensus of what should be considered ‘acceptable’, some will say that defending oneself, family, and friends is perfectly acceptable, others disagree and feel the only ‘acceptable’ would be hunting for food, then you have the extremists who don’t think any. These tend to be vegetarians surviving off the earth and whatever else they can find. Unlike many ‘humans’(to a degree) the Avian’s never quite developed that cruelty. They are a peaceful race and it is rare to find them fighting in wars of any kind unless they were forced into it.<br />
<br />
They are still very close to their ‘natural roots’ and are often described as being more ‘animal’ then ‘human’. This can lead to some awkward scenes when a certain Avian isn’t used to human customs. Nudity is not uncommon thing amongst their people they not needing to find anything sexual in such things and they tend to be perfectly at east in situations that others might find humiliating. They enjoy physical contact with others and this too can often lead to complicated situations with other species that aren’t as comfortable with it.<br />
<br />
Avians like with some of their ‘bird brothers’ mate for life. they are very loyal in their relationships and they tend to stay together with limited separation. Long separations are hard on them and death of the other partner can be a ‘devastating’ blow. Once a partner passes away they aren’t likely to move on from that mate and they will remain single for the rest of their lives. They are social by nature needing (stress the ‘NEEDING) social contact and relationships. They ‘were never meant’ to be alone. Actually the best way to torture one is to isolate them removing all forms of contact eventually it would probably drive them insane.<br />
<br />
There are no known societies of just Avian’s instead they tend to make tight knit clans/tribes amongst themselves living amongst the other societies. Their tribes are usually small yet supportive, they gaining strength off one another. There is usually some form of communications between the tribes mainly to prevent interbreeding (need new non-relatives to be mates). Which usually means the tribes can seemingly be constantly changing to a degree.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick</b></h1>
<br />
(no magic but they do have special abilities…)<br />
<br />
As a race of <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> their magics come from the air origin<a href="" title="Create page: origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They are a mixed race though so have unusual evolved abilities.<br />
<br />
Avians have the ability to shape-shift into the form of their bird brothers. Though they can shift into any bird they please the individual will usually have a particular breed they tend to gravitate towards.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Healing_b_'></a><h2><b>Healing</b></h2>
<br />
They have the power of 'healing', not others but themselves, they heal faster then other mortals, this is to help prevent major damage from happening if they break a wing or something along the lines. It is also speculated that this also a soft of ‘adaptation’ to help them survive the operation many do go through.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Flight_b_'></a><h2><b>Flight</b></h2>
<br />
Their wings do grant them flight though it does take up a lot of energy (as it does with birds).<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Photographic_memory_b_'></a><h2><b>Photographic memory</b></h2>
<br />
Avians for whatever reasons seem to have a ‘photographic’ memory, though maybe not really a power it does come in useful. One should always watch what they say around an Avian as they will remember it. This often leads to people believing that Avian’s are smarter then they might actually be. One does have to remember to distinguish the line between ‘remembering’ and ‘understanding’. The best example would be one remembering how to do some complicated formula, though they can remember how to do it doesn’t mean they understand why they do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Added_Information_b_'></a><h1><b>Added Information</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Healing_times_b_'></a><h2><b>Healing times</b></h2>
<br />
--Small/minor wounds (Flesh wounds, scraped, cuts, bruises, and the like) will heal instantly, since this doesn’t take much energy they are usually gone as quickly as they were made.<br />
<br />
--Medium wounds/gashes (deeper cuts, sprains, pulls, etc) can take anywhere from an hour to two hours depending on the severity of the wound itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
--Medium-severe: (deeper gashes, fatal gashes, broken bones to anything but wings, etc): these can take from two to three hours depending on how deep the gash or how severe the break. Wings will not heal in this time<br />
<br />
--Severe breaks: (Wing related, a tear in a wing, a broken wing, etc) the Avian’s wings are the most delicate part of their body, a broken or damaged wing can take anywhere from three to five hours to heal depending on exactly what was done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Avian_Diet_b_'></a><h2><b>Avian Diet</b></h2>
<br />
There diet can vary, to be more like a humans diet to being more like a bird's depending on how they live. Some will be vegetarians do to their closeness with nature, but most will only refuse to eat bird, though even this is not entirely true. In the wild they often take on the form of a bird to hunt, this usually means taking on the form of a 'bird of prey' only because they get the bigger meals, that offer more, but it is not unheard of them using other forms to eat. They need to obtain a diet that like a birds tend to be high in fat. This is for the energy that such foods produce, this is especially true if they are in anyway using flight be it in human form or bird form. Since flying burns energy they need to make sure they eat enough to sustain it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Avian_Strengths_and_Weaknesses_b_'></a><h2><b>Avian Strengths and Weaknesses</b></h2>
<br />
<a name='_b_Physical_Strengths_b_'></a><h3><b>Physical Strengths:</b></h3>
<br />
They are light and agile, they tend to be sure on their feet giving them the ability to move quickly and still go undetected if need-be.<br />
They have enhanced senses, with stronger eyesight and the natural keenness of the bird. This allows them to be able to get a decent ‘aerial’ view of the ground or things below them during flight.<br />
Like other birds of pretty they have sharp hearing and can pick up the sound of a mouse from a good distance away.<br />
Smell is probably one of the weaker senses though still heightened to a degree.<br />
The heightened senses help them keep out of danger and hunt as it makes finding prey/food easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Weaknesses_b_'></a><h3><b>Weaknesses:</b></h3>
<br />
though rather strong for their size (like a bird), there small stature makes them rather weak in a fight. Their wings also prove an easy target, and breaking a wing can be devastating do the fact if the wing is not set right, or if broken badly enough they may never fly again.<br />
They tend to be pushovers to an extent often trying to make peace with everyone which makes exploiting them easily. Because of this they end up as slaves or something similar easily.<br />
Blending for them can be a difficult task especially with the wings still attached since their frame is oddly shaped, the wings also prove hard to hide.<br />
Their quick digestive system makes starving easy for them and it can take a mere three to five days for them to end up starving.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Avian_Genetics_and_Physiology_b_'></a><h1><b>Avian Genetics and Physiology</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Genetics_b_'></a><h2><b>Genetics:</b></h2>
<br />
Avians are pretty much ‘humans with wings’, this means that they are in every sense of the word the same species as humans*, since they can breed and have fertile offspring with humans. When an Avian breeds with a normal human the gene for the species is Dominate so if one parent is a full Avian Shifter then the child will carry the gene, and it will show. Though the genes have been known to blend, and mix, which has caused some strange hybrids, this is rare, when it comes to normal humans, the Avian’s gene tend to overpower humans, so even minor Avian blood usually results in wings.<br />
<br />
_!!_Organs:__<br />
<br />
They have all the same organs as a human, just differently sized and placed in the body.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lungs_b_'></a><h3><b>Lungs:</b></h3>
<br />
They have lungs, but are somewhat smaller, and are attached to air-sacs, both anterior and posterior, this makes their respiratory system closer to a birds. The chain of air sacs allows a one way flow of air.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Heart_b_'></a><h3><b>Heart:</b></h3>
<br />
Their hearts are huge, and has been more then once said to be closer to a 'horse's size', this might be an exaggeration, but it gets the point across. This powerful heart allows for lots of blood to be pumped, which gives them the endurance needed to fly long distances, and helps keep cells oxygenated even at high altitudes. The large heart also helps in exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Body_systems_b_'></a><h2><b>Body 'systems':</b></h2>
<br />
<a name='_b_Respiratory_system_b_'></a><h3><b>Respiratory system:</b></h3>
<br />
It is more like a bird's then a human's, (so this was gained by pretty much looking up a bird's respiratory system). The respiratory system delivers oxygen from the air to the tissues and also removed carbon dioxide. In addition, like a bird's the respiratory system plays an important role in maintaining normal body temperature (called thermoregulation). What makes the avian respiratory system different from other vertebrates such as their human cousins, is that like birds Avians have relatively small lungs, and have nine air sacs that play an important role in respiration (though they aren't exactly involved in the exchange of gasses). The air sacs permit a unidirectional flow (one way flow of air), which means that the air moving through their lungs is largely 'fresh' air, and has a higher oxygen content. (This contrast with other mammals, which have a air flow that is 'bidirectional' or two way air flow, moving back and forth into and out of the lungs. As a result, air coming into a normal mammal's lungs is mixed with 'old air' (air that has been in the lungs for a while), and this mixed air has less oxygen.). This difference results in Avian lungs having more oxygen available to diffuse into blood. Like birds Avians have about 9 air sacs.<br />
<br />
--one interclavicular sac<br />
--two cervical sacs two anterior thoracic sacs<br />
--two posterior thoracic sacs<br />
--two abdominal sacs<br />
<br />
Functionally, these 9 air sacs can be divided into anterior sacs (interclavicular, cervicals, &amp; anterior thoracics) &amp; posterior sacs (posterior thoracics &amp; abdominals). Air sacs have very thin walls with few blood vessels. So, they do not play a direct role in gas exchange. Rather, they act as a 'bellows' to ventilate the lungs (Powell 2000). How air flows: . through the avian lungs &amp; air sacs during respiration 1 - On first inhalation, . air flows through the trachea &amp; bronchi &amp; primarily into the posterior (rear) air sacs 2 - On exhalation, . air moves from the posterior air sacs &amp; into the lungs 3<br />
<br />
- With the second inhalation, . air moves from the lungs &amp; into the anterior (front) air sacs 4 - With the second exhalation, . air moves from the anterior air sacs back into the trachea &amp; out Air flow is driven by changes in pressure within the respiratory system: &quot; During inspiration: o the sternum moves forward &amp; downward while the vertebral ribs move cranially to expand the sternal ribs &amp; the thoracoabdominal cavity. This expands the posterior &amp; anterior air sacs &amp; lowers the pressure, causing air to move into those air sacs. &quot; Air from the trachea &amp; bronchi moves into the posterior air sacs &amp;, simultaneously, &quot; air from the lungs moves into the anterior air sacs. &quot; During expiration: o the sternum moves backward &amp; upward &amp; the vertebral ribs move caudally to retract the sternal ribs &amp; reduce the volume of the thoracoabdominal cavity. The reduces the volume of the anterior &amp; posterior air sacs causing air to move out of those sacs. &quot; Air from the posterior sacs moves into the lungs &amp;, simultaneously, &quot; air from the anterior sacs moves into the trachea &amp; out of the body. So, it takes two respiratory cycles to move one 'packet' of air completely through the avian respiratory system. The advantage, though, is that air, high in oxygen content, always moves unidirectionally through the lungs. (research and info on the respiratory system taken from<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Metabolism_b_'></a><h3><b>Metabolism:</b></h3>
<br />
They have a much faster metabolism then a humans, though they eat less, they need to eat more often then a human, and this can cause them to starve much faster then a human would. This though helps keep them light weight, also burns food quicker so they can use it as energy during flight.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Reproduction_system_b_'></a><h3><b>Reproduction system:</b></h3>
They are born like humans, and breed like humans, since they are mammals. This means that they age normally too, they do nurse their young. Their gestation period like a human's is nine months,<br />
<br />
Their bones tend to be lighter yet stronger (to withhold flight) then a humans but still they can’t take much direct damage (one will often guess they are hallow to a degree but this has never been tested or proven).<br />
<br />
<br />
The textbook definition of species is that it is a group of organisms which can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. So humans of all races are the same species, but horses and donkeys aren't. Any normal, healthy male and female human can mate and produce offspring which are not only perfectly healthy, but are also perfectly capable of producing eggs or sperm and interbreeding with the rest of the species. But while a horse and donkey can mate, and they produce a very healthy offspring (which we call a mule) that mule is sterile.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Avian_Society_b_'></a><h1><b>Avian Society</b></h1>
<br />
They are social creatures, and prefer to be in groups rather then alone. They prefer to sleep in large groups too, having none of the human hang-ups, and it not exactly strange to find them sharing sleeping quarters, and 'sleeping nude' together. They are in a way more animal-like in that area, and prefer the contact of others. Though do to human society this has gotten much less common as the human's opinion often have them afraid to do it. There are no societies of only Avians, which is why they tend to follow the rule of humans or whoever they are living under, this is mainly do to the fact there not an extremely large number of them, and the population of them is often spread out. They are pleasant creatures though as a whole, even with their 'arrogant' moments, and they have a high respect for living things, and life in general, and because of this many of them often try and protect what they can. There of course is a few 'bad apples' mixed in, but as a whole they are a 'good' species. They tend to live in the wild too, and when they don't, they live in wide open homes, with large windows, with a large group of other Avians. They need the sun, and so on, being kept from it has driven more then one Avian insane. They are not nocturnal creatures saying the least, though even the night sky is something great to them. since they are built to fly, they tend to need the outdoors<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Operation_b_'></a><h1><b>The Operation</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
The ‘operation’: Many Avians go through what is simply referred to as ‘the operation’ as children, this is something that cannot be done to older Avians and is likely to kill them or leave them severely deformed (at best). children are able to bounce back from the operation much easier. Still it can take a healthy child anywhere from 5-8 hours to heal from the procedure. The individual needs to be closely watched the first hours after the operation to ensure that they don’t end up ‘crashing’.<br />
<br />
The operation: Do to tensions between Avians and Humans the Avians needed a way to ‘blend’ since this was hard when they still had their wings they soon developed a way of removing them. It is often argued now if it is still a necessary part of surviving or simply a long-winded and painful tradition. One thing that has to be noted though is that this operation should only be done at a young age, the oldest an Avian can be upon removing their wings is 10, though preferably younger, and sometimes 10 is to old, it HAS to be done before puberty hits. This is because the body will fix the Avian's proportions, making them appear more human; this is believed to have evolved as a way of blending. Though certain things will always remain, the feathering, the organ differences, rib-cage, and other minor things, the arms and legs do fix, and has to be done before the major growth spurt.<br />
<br />
The operation is a painful one though, and it complicated, and the best time to do it is at birth (same reason you circumcise a boy right away). The procedure will leave scars down, along the arms, and where the wings attached to the body, (hands, shoulders, etc). The procedure is said to be so painful, that an avian, with their quick minds, can remember it if it done even as late as 6-months. The problem is that finding someone who can do it correctly, with out actually causing damage to the arm, is hard and it often not done until a child is about two years old or older. The procedure is often viewed by the avian species as something 'horrible' as it is a traumatizing and painful event that leaves behind scaring to remind them of it (As if they need the reminder, with their brains they tend to remember everything), but at the same time it was often viewed as necessary as they weren't exactly the most welcomed species in the human world. The procedure though is now being questioned and there is a good chance it now just being done in tradition. The operation is said to be so 'dangerous' and 'painful' that if they didn't have the healing power it would probably kill 99% of them.<br />
