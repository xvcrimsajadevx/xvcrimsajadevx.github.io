<a name='_b_The_Light_of_Creation_b_'></a><h1><b>The Light of Creation</b></h1>
<br />
The Light was life, the Light was the beginning of all that is good... the Light, the power of Creation, the font of knowledge and love and wonderment.<br />
<br />
The Light is in peril.<br />
<br />
A candle's tiny light can dispel the darkness, it can be a beacon from far away, seen by all.<br />
<br />
The three <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> are the three candles struggling to not be blown out. Only three, but their Light shines through all of existence, maintaining the balance of good and evil, of Order and Chaos...<br />
<br />
<br />
The Light is the Primal Power of Life. It is a force, a power, but an intelligent force. Its only goal is to sustain the balance of existence, maintain the equilibrium with its opposing power of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>. For everything that is created, it knows an opposition is needed. For every life there must be death, and for there to be Light there must be shadow.<br />
<br />
But with death came the theft of Human Souls, souls that the Light were imbued with a portion of its creator. For every human soul lost, some of the Light dwindled out of existence. The balance was tipping precariously with the Darkness corrupting and consuming the Light. The War raged and All Worlds but one was lost. with only one world left the Light had no other choice. It selected three souls from this world and split itself between them, existing in totality in each of them. The peoples of the Nether Realm fought the Darkness back, and protected the Light Bearers from the Minions the Darkness had creating to hunt down its enemy.<br />
<br />
The Elf Orion, and Wizard Aurora and the Human Annais are the last hopes of All Worlds, if the Minions find them, then no matter how hard the races fight, the War is lost, and The Nether Realm will fall...<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Races_of_the_Light_b_'></a><h1><b>Races of the Light</b></h1>
<br />
The only race of the Light are <a title="Humans" href='Humans.html' class='wiki'>Humans</a>, and of course the hume sub types such as <a title="Barbarians" href='Barbarians.html' class='wiki'>Barbarians</a>, <a title="Halflings" href='Halflings.html' class='wiki'>Halflings</a>, <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> and <a title="Summoners" href='Summoners.html' class='wiki'>Summoners</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Powers_of_the_Light_b_'></a><h1><b>The Powers of the Light</b></h1>
<br />
Light Bearers can create gates to other worlds, and have all the powers of creation. They can regenerate/heal quickly, teleport and read minds in addition to their own natural abilities. They are immortal beings and can only be destroyed by Minions of Darkness and hold the ability to create new races of Light.<br />
<br />
<a class="wiki"  href="http://www.thenetherrealm.com/wiki/Clerics#_b_Clerics_of_the_Light_b_.html">Clerics of the Light</a> have toned down versions of the types of spells a Light Bearer can perform.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Light_Bearers_b_'></a><h1><b>The Light Bearers</b></h1>
<br />
There are only three <a title="Light Bearers" href='Light+Bearers.html' class='wiki'>Light Bearers</a> ever in existence, and when one dies, if there is no Bearer (potential Light Bearer) in the vicinity, then the Light within that soul is lost forever. The soul of Light must be of the same race as the Light Bearer, or the Light cannot be transferred and survive.<br />
<br />
Once all three are dead, All Worlds are thrown into Chaos and the Darkness consumes everything.<br />
