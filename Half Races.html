<a name='_b_AREVEN_b_'></a><h1><b>AREVEN</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Areven (Plural Areveni)<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> They live mostly scattered across the eastern continent, but, as they can fly, they can be found almost anywhere, if they wish to.<br />
<br />
<b>Religion:</b> The Areveni believe in an ancient god who rose after all the other gods and saw the weaknesses of both Cael - Aviens<a href="" title="Create page: Aviens"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and <a title="Humans" href='Humans.html' class='wiki'>Humans</a> and decided to make them strong. This god is neither male nor female and is simply known as &quot;Immortal'.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> On average, most die from battle wounds, illnesses, etc, but those who live as long s possible can reach 100.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b> A race which combines very well the aspects of both their ancestors, with wings sprouting from their backs and bird-like heads that have traces of human features, such as teeth within the beaks. Their females have breasts like humans for nursing their young, but have clawed feet instead of toes, for defending their young.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b> A very scattered race, they are generally loners who then, if they find another of their species, mate for life and give birth only once. As such, they are a very small population.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h2><b>History</b></h2>
<br />
The Areveni were created in the general area of the late 4000's when a group of exiled Cael - Avien were accepted into a band of nomadic <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a>s, and after years of wandering together, a <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a> women fell for a Cael - Avien man. the Areveni lived in the land of the <a title="Nyoryn" href='Nyoryn.html' class='wiki'>Nyoryn</a>s for centuries until they discovered their longing to fly and scattered.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_SANGRE_b_'></a><h1><b>SANGRE</b></h1>
<br />
<div class="simplebox"><div align="center">THIS RACE IS NOT OPEN FOR APPLICATIONS. THIS IS A REFERENCE TOPIC ONLY. ONLY HALF BREEDS OF THIS RACE WILL BE ACCEPTED, WHICH IS WHY IT IS IN THE HALF RACE ARTICLE</div></div><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Name:</b> Sangre Demon<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> There are too few of them to tell...<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b>  Immortal (Though they can be killed it is extremely difficult)<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
They are often described to be ‘something from nightmares’ a mix of something human and something else entirely. Their true forms are no longer known do to them loosing them long ago trapping them in their (winged) humanoid form they now possess. They are strange looking creatures standing no taller then five-foot tops (even the males) with a stubby muscular build. Though short they tend to be bulky with out it getting in the way. They tend to be quick on their feet and strong fighters.<br />
<br />
They can range anywhere from being fair skin to a deep tan. Fair skinned tend to be pearly white as if carved out of marble or as they are often described ‘look like the dead’. Tanned skin can appear from anywhere from normal to having a reddish tint to it.<br />
<br />
The wings of a full blooded Sangre can range anywhere from a mere four to seven times their height and their has been a few cases of larger. Average is about six to six and half times their height (making them for the average five foot Sangre thirty to thirty-two and half feet). The wings aren’t feathered but instead tend to be more like a bat’s wings or ‘the typical’ demon wings of just skin pulled across the skeleton. Each wing ends in three points (typical demon looking wing). They tend to be a deep red though they can also go from red to black (black tipping). Because the wings are awkward though most of the time they do not sport them, having the ability to shift them away they tend to keep them that way.<br />
<br />
Half breeds wings can span anywhere form four times to six times the most common being five (25 feet wingspan) which makes them a good deal smaller then a full blooded. Also unlike the full-blooded wings their wings are feathered and tend to have a blood-red feathers with black mixed in. One ability they share with their full blooded species is the ability to shift them away and they also tend to keep them shifted off.<br />
<br />
Their eyes also tend to be a bit on the strange eyes, speckled between a deep blood red and black. The eyes do tend to bleed to red with power use and black with anger though.<br />
<br />
They have two pair of fangs upper and bottom that do not retract. They tend to use them to their advantage<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits:</b><br />
<br />
most tend to be cruel and a bit on the sadistic side. They aren’t ones to ally themselves with anyone even sometimes themselves. They are arrogant fools who tend to view themselves as the strongest and best things around which is probably what let to their destruction. They seem to constantly be seeking out confrontations as a way of proving themselves.<br />

<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h2><b>Magic</b></h2>
<br />
Though it alters between individuals the main seems to be similar to the magics of the Origin <a title="Pyra" href='Pyra.html' class='wiki'>Pyra</a>. It is mainly fire magic with some other minor things added in (Self healing and the shifting away of the wings) abilities will vary though by the individual and what they study.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h2><b>Extra Info</b></h2>
