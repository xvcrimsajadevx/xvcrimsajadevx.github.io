<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Cael - Avien live mainly in the skies of the Nether Realm, only returning to land to rest and give birth. They can be found all over the Realm in any region that has high mountainous regions or are particularly hard for the other races to get to.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Average lifespan is around sixty to seventy years, while it is not unknown for Cael - Avien's to reach one hundred. Although given their culture it is rare indeed for one to reach these ages.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b> The Cael - Avien appear as a human with a bird’s head and wings sprouting from their shoulders. The type of bird varies from region to region. Cultural differences also allow for some Cael - Aviens to have human hands while others have more talon like digits and the same applies for their legs. As it is not uncommon for Cael - Aviens from different regions to breed with others these differences are not specific to the regional groups.<br />
<br />
The male and Female Cael - Aviens, despite having humanoid bodies, have very few differences. The female Cael - Avien do not have breasts as they do not suckle their young (see Additional Information), they are instead just slightly smaller yet their wings tend to be larger than the males.<br />

<b>Personality Traits:</b> Cael - Aviens are considered a warlike race by others, with the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> in particular looking down on them. Yet while they regularly fight amongst themselves they see it as something of a sport and except in rare cases there are seldom serious casualties. They are an adventurous race, yet they are generally nervous around races besides others of the Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>.<br />
<br />
Cael - Aviens speak in a series of coos and tweets and while they are capable of speaking other languages the average Cael - Avien spend too little time in the company of other races to learn their tongue.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Another of the many races of <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> it became common knowledge as a result of the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> that the Cael - Avien were created as a build up to creating them. Although it has since come to light that the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> are the second race created after the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> meaning that in fact the Cael - Avien were created later.<br />
<br />
They only rarely get involved with other races. They mix with other races of <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> only to fight in the same playful manner as they do with their own, although the other races do not understand this and see them as somewhat of a childish race with particular animosity between them and the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> who consider them a real nuisance. They only fight <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a> and other races when the feel their territory has been invaded and as they only land at length to give birth it tends to be a violent encounter as the Cael - Avien feels it has to protect it’s young.<br />

<br />
As a race of <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a> they are able to use its powers as do the other races. Although as they tend to be a race that responds to animal instincts their magic tends to be subconsciously learned and not taught.<br />

<br />
A Cael - Avien is born in a manner similar to human birth, but they are reared in a manner more akin to birds. Once the Cael - Avien child is born a parent must remain with it using it's body heat to warm the child until it's feathers thicken.<br />
<br />
The parent who is not warming the child finds food which is regurgitated into the mouth of the child. The two parents are needed as a new born left before his feathers grow will more often than not perish, should a parent die the other members of the flock (the groups in which the Cael - Avien's gather) will help out. A parent who deserts their child and partner is hunted and killed.<br />
