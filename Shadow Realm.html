<br />
The Shadow Realm is not made by the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> nor the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>, yet most refer to The Shadow Realm as being one of the Other Worlds. As it has no place in the Universe, we will put it here for reference sake, but understand that this place is untouched by all but the Ether. It is a bubble in Existence and only penetrated by the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a>, and only then in a type of Astral form (they must leave their bodies and travels through the Void in order to reach the home of the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>.)<br />
<br />
The <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> are ethereal here and have no corporeal bodies. they have their own society and powers, the Shadow Realm has also bred new types of majicks never seen in the Nether Realm or any of All Worlds or the Other Worlds. This realm has a dreamlike quality, the Eria appear as apparitions, floating and sometimes even fighting. there are many Eria here who have never used the <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> to manifest themselves in the Nether Realm. There is a faction of Eria who believe it is wrong to breach the Nether Realm, as the Shadow Realm is not a part of Existence, and by doing so they are upsetting the balance. The <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> are their shadows, and by coming into contact with their world they are interfering with the equilibrium of both.<br />
<br />
That is the view of the majority of <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a>, but <a title="Abeona" href='Abeona.html' class='wiki'>Abeona</a> lobbies her cause for her race to become a part of Existence, she was the first to learn how to use the Quasi as a conduit, and she has since gone on to discover other gateways. These are only one way and no other race can enter the Shadow Realm in corporeal form.<br />
<br />
The majicks of this realm are sometimes referred to as the Astral Majicks by the Quasi. Sometimes, when a particular Eria is feeling mischievous, shadow monsters breach the Nether Realm and cause havoc until found by an Eria and taken back to the Shadow Realm.<br />
