<a name='_b_Overview_b_'></a><h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<br />
Clerics are individuals who get powers from their god. They are imbued with abilities they may not have been born with (so for instance a hume could worship a Djinn and that Djinn could give them the Ether ability). Cleric powers are usually prayed for and a cleric must have faith to use their powers. A deity will know if their cleric has lost faith and will withdraw their powers.<br />

<a name='_b_Origin_Clerics_b_'></a><h3><b>Origin Clerics</b></h3>
<br />
Sometimes referred as Priests or Priestesses, these are individuals from the <a title="origins" href='origins.html' class='wiki'>origins</a> races who specialise in specific spells granted to them by their origin. (See the <a title="bestiary" href='bestiary.html' class='wiki'>bestiary</a> for additional Origin Races beyond their primary races).<br />
<br />
Powers of origin clerics are normally mastered versions of the Origin spells and race spells, but for clerics they can only perform them if they have faith and the stronger their faith the more powerful the spell. These clerics also have the added ability of being able to summon the avatar of their origin.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Djinn_Clerics_b_'></a><h3><b>Djinn Clerics</b></h3>
<br />
Sometimes referred as Priests or Priestesses, these are individuals from the Djinn races or those imbued with powers by the Djinn who specialise in specific spells granted to them by their God/Goddess. <a class="wiki"  href="http://www.thenetherrealm.com/wiki/Religion#_b_Djinn_Cults_b_.html">Djinn Worshippers</a> are not uncommon, but the clerics or priests/priestesses are. These individuals are normally high up in the cult and are granted specific majicks and powers by their god/goddess.<br />
<br />
Djinn clerics can also call upon their deity and summon them in times of need.<br />
