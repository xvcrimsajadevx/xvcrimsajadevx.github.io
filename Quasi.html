<br />
<b>Name:</b> Quasi<br />
<br />
The Quasi are humans that can use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>, but not to do magic spells as that ability is replaced or burned out of them by the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> who use them as a conduit. Some <a title="Humans" href='Humans.html' class='wiki'>Humans</a> choose to use the Ether to summon Eria, and are adopted Quasi. All Quasi summon the <a title="Eria" href='Eria.html' class='wiki'>Eria</a> through the <a title="Art of Summoning" href='Art+of+Summoning.html' class='wiki'>Art of Summoning</a>.<br />
<br />
They must not be confused with the basic summoners who can only summon creatures from the Shadow Realm. The Quasi are more powerful and summon the Eria. For more information on the weaker version of summoners go to <a title="Summoners" href='Summoners.html' class='wiki'>Summoners</a><br />
<br />
The Quasi are now a sub-race of hume as they have evolved so the ability to contact the Shadow Realm has become part of their biology.<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b><br />
<br />
 The Quasi are the descendant of the people who inhabited the island of Aether, and are any human who has the talent for summoning. These humans leave their homes to seek out the wandering Quasi Tribes. When Aether was destroyed by the Minions, the Quasi were scattered to the corners of the world. Now they are nomadic tribes who travel the world in tribes. These tribes are hunted down and killed by the Minions though, so only a few have survived.<br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b><br />
<br />
Extended; like <a title="Wizards" href='Wizards.html' class='wiki'>Wizards</a> and <a title="Sorcerers" href='Sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>Sorcerers</a>, the Ether increases their lives.<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
The Quasi tend to wear clothes made from animal hides from whatever animals they hunt in a particular region. They sometimes get the chance to buy clothes when they go into towns and cities to trade. But usually there are more important things to by rather then clothes. They wear slacks, tunics and soft boots for all weathers for both men and women and children, and cloaks for poor weather. For the elders, the senior summoners, in the Tribe there are robes of silk and velvet and satin, the Quasi colours depend on the tribe.<br />
<br />
All the men have one long braid going down the middle of their backs, but they do not shave their hair. The women have their hair braided into hundreds of little braids, with many lengths and colours and bells and beads woven into them. High summoners can be distinguished by the tattoos on their hands, the same on both the left and the right hand. Depending on their specialization, depends on what creature is tattooed onto their hands.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality Traits</b><br />
<br />
The Quasi are as varied as any human society. Being a nomadic tribe they tend to be very wary of strangers and protective of their way of life. They are friendly, but only to those who come to them not bearing weapons are truly welcome. They are too used to the Minions hunting them down, and even dwelling amongst them and killing them one at a time. Always the powerful summoners are killed first.<br />
<br />
The Quasi are a fierce people, strong in spirit and strong in battle. The women fight alongside the men in summoning, the hierarchy in the Quasi is made up of youth and elders, men and women, strong and weak. The strong are fiercely protected as they are the ones who can summon more then one Eria at any one time. These youngsters tend to be quiet arrogant once they have become Quasi-kal, and seek adventure beyond the restrictions of their tribe. The stronger the summoner, the harder it is for the tribe to let them go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
They inhabited the island of Aether, gather from all over the Nether Realm, and from there strived to summon new Eria. The ancient Quasi defended the island for many generations, but eventually were defeated by the Minions of Darkness.<br />
<br />
Portals that go to the Shadow Realm are believed to reside in the Quasi Temple, hidden by magic on the island of Aether, which no living soul but the Quasi know the location of.<br />
<br />
It is thought that the Quasi have the ability to teleport themselves, and those summoners who find them to their ancient home, and guide them through the temple to the portals and visit the Eria. The Quasi believe that one day their people will be reunited in Aether, summoned by the Light they will be at the Last Battle, they believe they must be there to summon the Eria against the Djinn (so the Quasi believe, not the Eria though). Prophecy tells them the Djinn will be on the side of Darkness, upsetting the balance of All Worlds, so therefore the Eria must fight for the Light to keep All Worlds neutral and balance intact.<br />
<br />
The Quasi-kals are the high summoners, and the Quasi-talem are the Apprentices. Quasi become Apprenticed to summoning at the age of 12. All Quasi train as summoners, as well as there practical trade (like a weaver, merchant, blacksmith, hunter), as the ability to summon is in their blood. Only those who are Quasi-kal can use summon in battle though.<br />

<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aether_b_'></a><h1><b>Aether</b></h1>
<br />
The ruined city of Jalina is where the Temple of the Gates is rumoured to be.<br />
<br />
Aether is a large island that was inhabited by a powerful race of summoners. It was a prosperous land, rich in farming and mining of gold and diamond and magic crystals the Quasi call Xswsa. Some believe the Xswsa can be imbued with the power to summon an Eria, so even those without the power to summon can call on these magical creatures.<br />
<br />
Modern Aether is in ruins. The great cities and temples of the Quasi are rubble, the domes and towers of shimmering gold now buried. When the Quasi return with summoners outside their tribe they say a prayer for their people, praying for the time they can return to Aether and rebuild it into a great nation once more.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Hierarchy_b_'></a><h1><b>Hierarchy</b></h1>
<br />
Before the Sundering, Aether had a Senate of High Summoners. Policies were voted on by these twelve members.<br />
<br />
The modern Quasi are now in tribes of 100 Quasi, twelve main tribes that have offshoots when the numbers exceed 100. The twelve main tribes have one Senator from the high Council each. Theses members serve in this office until their death, and then a new one is elected by the tribe. Once every 50 years the Senate meets in the Temple of the Gates, where they discuss the status of the Quasi.<br />
<br />
Each tribe lives by Aether’s ancient laws; the senator is judge and jury. The only law punishable by death is revealing the location of Aether to outsiders. Banishment from the tribe is incurred when a quasi-talem summons illegally. The punishment is so sever because summoning before you can control the Eria can result in hundreds of deaths and killing of the summoner himself.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Culture</b></h1>
<br />
The Quasi travel slowly, mainly, using wagons and carts.<br />
<br />
Until its ruination Aether was a hub of trade. Being such a rich land drew merchants and traders from far and wide, to sell as well as buy Aether’s wares and goods.<br />
<br />
The Quasi now have merchants go into cities to sell what they make and buy what they need.<br />
<br />
In some human societies those born with the talent are encouraged to choose to seek the Quasi rather then choose Wizardry. Wizards try to coerce these untapped humans to choose their magic schools, as if someone wants to become a summoner later they can, after training as a wizard. But if you choose summoning, there is no way back...you can never be a wizard. This has created much prejudice in wizards against the Quasi culture.<br />
