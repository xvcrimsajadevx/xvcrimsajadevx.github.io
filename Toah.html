<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Toah is a muscular man, tall and wide, with long blonde hair, thick eyebrows that frame his fierce, bright, blue glowing eyes. He has a deep, resonating voice that thunders in the mountain forges. He wears animals skins for his clothes, and is usually covered in sweat caused by the heat of the forge.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
His temples vary. Some are simple works of stone, some are more elaborate edifices. The indulgent ones he ignores as he is a modest Djinn. He only wishes to be praised for his work, not his power.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Toah can forge any magical sword, to any specification. His own creations are mysterious and rarely given to just anybody. Many of his weapons are hidden throughout the Nether Realm for the worthy to find and weild. He created many weapons with the Dwarves, and legend says it is believed that he, along with a mysterious elf, made Excalibur.. He has disowned the sword and will not speak of it.<br />
<br />
