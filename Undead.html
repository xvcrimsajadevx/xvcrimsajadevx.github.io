<a name='_b_What_are_the_Undead_b_'></a><h1><b>What are the Undead?</b></h1>
<br />
The races of Darkness consist of demons and the undead. The Undead are creatures of unlife, the opposite of life and embody everything the Darkness is.... death. Zombies, Lichs, and Vampyres are the legions of undead but there are other unknown creatures out there that are too few to number. Following are more details regarding the individual races of Undead. Vampyres being the primary race of Darkness have far more detailed information.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Zombies_b_'></a><h1><b>Zombies</b></h1>
<br />
Zombies are the empty shells left by the Aluka and most are controlled by the Aluka. those not made by the Aluka are often controlled or made by necromancers. This is not a universal rule, zombies can be made other ways and as long as they have the same basic abilities as Aluka zombies this is acceptable. Aluka cannot make more then a single zombie a day and cannot control more then ten at any one time. Zombies are for the most part not sentient creatures but there are some that have retained some of their humanity and mind, such as lichs. Zombies powers are limited to some regeneration (if they are aluka made zombies) and super strength that enables them to tears limbs off humes. They crave live meat and will eat hume (or any other creature that moves) flesh, not needing sharp teeth to take the flesh as their strength enables them to rip it easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lichs_b_'></a><h2><b>Lichs</b></h2>
<br />
In the Nether Realm lichs are basically sentient zombies who have their soul trapped by another and are at their mercy or who hold their own soul and guard it in a phylactery (which would be enchanted by a necromancer and kept on the licjh at all times - many lichs are former necromancers actually). They are undead creatures who was once a hume and has had (performed on them) or used necromantic rituals or objects to bind their intellect to their animated corpse and thereby achieve a perverse form of immortality.<br />
<br />
Liches are clearly cadaverous, their bodies desiccated or even completely skeletal. Liches are not extremely powerful magically in this world, their powers over other less sentient undead creatures are limited and they do not hold as much sway as the Aluka. They may be sentient but they often lose their sanity, some retaining their humanity to a degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Vampyres_b_'></a><h1><b>Vampyres</b></h1>
<br />
As vampyres are the primary race of undead they have a lot more detailed information.<br />
<br />
Vampyres are a twisted reflection of humans, they are their shadows, and an echo of the Light's only creation. They were what the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> thought Humes should be, and a mockery too.<br />
<br />
They are the purest race of the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, and the only race to be imbued with shadow powers. Only one type of vampyre were deemed the mirror image of humans. The other type are the purest race of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and the most ferocious and malign.<br />
<br />
There are two types of Vampires, the Lamia who have the blood lust and the Aluka who siphon the souls of other creatures and consume them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lamia_blood_vampyre_s_b_'></a><h2><b>Lamia (blood vampyre's)</b></h2>
<br />
<br />
Undead creatures that feed of the blood of the living. They are strongest at night and dwell wherever <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a> are. They are weak in sunlight, and at mid-day will burst into flames if the light of the midday sun touches their skins. They are pale creatures, some (mostly nobles) with fully black eyes that glow red in utter darkness and claws (the commoners tend to have purple eyes and more human hands). They are intelligent and believe they should be the dominant race of Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and that they are the Chosen Race.<br />
<br />
<b>Name:</b> The Lamia<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Aeternus Caliga<a href="" title="Create page: Aeternus+Caliga"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, <a title="Ramakasiz" href='Ramakasiz.html' class='wiki'>Ramakasiz</a><br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> 1,000 to 2,000 years<br />
<br />
Lamia can reproduce, their status of undead is because of the state of their souls. Lamia pregnancy lasts for six months.<br />
<br />
The Lamia are mock humans and do have children but those children have tainted souls that enter their bodies at birth. If the mother was Lamia then any cross breed would be born undead. If the Lamia is the father then the child would be half Lamia but not necessarily undead and would likely not have the full blood lust.<br />
<br />
Very few Lamia are strong enough to make a vampire from a human. Few bother as <a title="humans" href='humans.html' class='wiki'>humans</a> are seen merely as food.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lamia_Appearance_b_'></a><h3><b>Lamia Appearance</b></h3>
<br />
The Lamia appear as humans but they do have very distinct features that mark them out as Undead. Nobles have hands that are longer then normal fingers and their nails make them look more like claws. The nobles are also distinct by their silver hair, and the commoners their black hair with silver streaks. They are pale and most nobles have fully black eyes that glow red in utter darkness, commoners tend to have purple eyes (but there are obviously random colours and tints in both common and noble Lamia).<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lamia_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h3><b>Lamia Personality Traits</b></h3>
<br />
The Lamia are arrogant like the Aluka, but they value power over humans more then anything else. They fear the primary races of the <a title="Origins" href='Origins.html' class='wiki'>Origins</a>, particularly the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a> and the <a title="Elves" href='Elves.html' class='wiki'>Elves</a>, and most of all the Vampyre Hunters. Their nobles are decadent and wasteful, they abuse their slaves and live lives of fools, balls and blood fill their hours. They treat the Aluka as servants, but do have an army of Lamia that are led by the Aluka generals. The princess Tiaiz is the leader of this army, and her body guard Rakis is the general.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lamia_History_b_'></a><h3><b>Lamia History</b></h3>
<br />
The Lamia have a spotted history. Often punished by the Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> for their consistent failures, their ventures into Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> normally end in disaster. A recent alliance with Apollyon has changed their fortunes somewhat and the current High Lord, Osiri seems to be making some headway. He has promised his daughter, Tiaiz to Apollyon in return for the Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>'s help in making the Lamia the dominant race on the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Lamia_Majicks_b_'></a><h3><b>Lamia Majicks</b></h3>
<br />
Their main weakness is fire, if they are set alight then they are utterly consumed and defeated. The older and more powerful the Lamia, the greater their resistance to fire. In the noble houses and at their balls they use it, but there are no naked flames, lamps are utilised and human servants light them, such is the fear of the Lamia.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Misc_Lamia_Information_b_'></a><h3><b>Misc Lamia Information</b></h3>
<br />
Undead creatures that feed of the blood of the living. They are strongest at night and dwell wherever humans are. They are weak in sunlight, and at mid-day will burst into flames if the light of the midday sun touches their skins. They are understandable pale creatures, with purple eyes and claws. they are intelligent and believe they should be the dominant race of Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and that they are the Chosen Race.<br />
<br />
Lamia are born, and only made using their shadow magics and lengthy rituals. Humans are chosen by Lamia for turning, and not turned when Lamia feed. Few Lamia are powerful enough and old enough to make vampires from humans, and it is not done often.<br />
<br />
The only adverse effects of vampire feeding is Lamia tend to drain their human completely. It takes great restraint to keep humans around as a constant source of food, but in a battle they would tear at the throat. On Aeternus Caliga<a href="" title="Create page: Aeternus+Caliga"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> in the houses of nobles the human slaves may be drained slower and with more etiquette so to speak, but that is more about acting human and not being savages, trying to emulate human society of which they are only a shadow of. Some even drink blood from chalices.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aluka_essence_vampyre_s_b_'></a><h2><b>Aluka (essence vampyre's)</b></h2>
<br />
Fierce creatures with exoskeletons and the build of warriors. They feed off the essences of all living things. They are powerful creatures, and are telepathic. They take on the memories and knowledge of what the victim whose essence they devour, leaving the prey a shell, an empty shell devoid of a soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Country/Region:</b> Aeternus Caliga<a href="" title="Create page: Aeternus+Caliga"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, <a title="Atra Arcis" href='Atra+Arcis.html' class='wiki'>Atra Arcis</a><br />
<br />
<b>Lifespan:</b> Immortal<br />
<br />
Aluka can reproduce, their status of undead is because of the state of their souls. Aluka souls are reincarnated, but the bodies are born again and new. Some believe the bodies are kept in stasis until they reach adulthood and then the soul is breathed into them and that is their true birth.<br />
<br />
Aluka mating is rare. The pregnancy lasting only 4 months, the baby Aluka not seen by anyone except the mother and never seen again until they are full adults. They are not exactly born alive either, the baby does not cry and the exo skeleton is weak. The stasis lasts for about 30 years, so it is rumoured, and the Aluka has a second, true birth.<br />
<br />
It is a well known fact that most Aluka men prefer Aluka women, but the women prefer Lamia men. It is outlawed for any Aluka to breed with Lamia (although as the male of the species rarely take a liking to the female Lamia, they cast a blind eye to this kind of union), Lamia are deemed by the Aluka as 'lesser beings'. Any spawn made from such a union is either destroyed or never acknowledged.<br />
<br />
All children of this union take on the blood thirst of the Lamia, and have a Lamia physiology. This is yet another reason the Aluka do not breed with them, as they want to increase their numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aluka_Appearance_b_'></a><h3><b>Aluka Appearance</b></h3>
<br />
The Aluka's physiology is very different from a Lamia's. Their flesh and sinew is fused with an exoskeleton which is more durable and flexible then bone. The flesh and exoskeleton have plates of armour fused onto the body also. This happens when any Aluka reaches adulthood. On a male Aluka the fused plates are across parts of the face, the chest, thighs and back. Other pieces of removable armour are attached to these melded plates, but when an Aluka is 'naked' they still have the melded armour affixed. Removing them is extremely painful and usually done as a punishment for traitors, deserters, and failures. This is their scar, their brand, and it tells others they are an outcast and unworthy.<br />
<br />
The fused plates of the female Aluka are applied only to the abdomen, the cranium and segregated plates on the back and thighs. Their faces are left clear, pale and almost beautiful, so when they are cloaked it is sometimes very hard to tell the difference between a female Aluka and a Lamia. The mark of any Aluka is always their eyes. Male or female, they are the same. Some female armour is more prominent (like their shoulder plates or skull caps) depending on their rank and occupation.<br />
<br />
The exoskeleton is a natural armour and protects the more fleshy, vulnerable parts of their body. It is not segregated, as a crustaceans or insects may be. It is flexible where it needs to be flexible, and rigid where it needs to be rigid. The Aluka have some control over the rigidity of their exoskeleton. If you are lucky enough to break through their armour and natural protections, you'll find their inner workings like any mortals. Their heart is harder to penetrate, but an enchanted blade, a strong powerful arm or a lucky blow would be enough to deliver a fatal blow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aluka_Personality_Traits_b_'></a><h3><b>Aluka Personality Traits</b></h3>
<br />
Aluka society is very xenophobic. They are a warring race and do not socialise much as a people. They live in forts and camps and travel in their battalions. They have no nobles and rank according to the army. Their children are dragged up rather then raised, and taught to fight from birth. For what they lack in eloquence they make up for in intelligence. They are very knowledgeable of other societies and scoff at it, thinking their own far more superior. They believe in knowing the enemy, and when they drain the essence of their prey they take on part of the knowledge of that soul. They speak rarely and communicate via telepathy, something else that separates them from their brethren, the Lamia. Another thing that confirms their belief that they are a higher race.<br />
<br />
Their hunger is a powerful one, and linked to the curse of the darkness on humans. As a pure race of the Darkness they serve him by consuming the souls of men, and trapping part of there essence in their own souls, while the rest of the human soul is trapped in Oblivion. This essence strengthens them, strengthens the Darkness by feeding it, and weakness the Light, subduing it, extinguishing it. Their hunger is the hunger for all men's souls... a soul consumed by an Aluka is tainted, the shell of the human a zombie and under the control of that Aluka. The wastelands of Zircun are littered with Aluka zombies, roaming the blasted lands empty shells of what they once were, devoid of thought and having no other purpose then serving the Aluka.<br />
<br />
The human farms on their continent are hidden underground. They hate humans, but hunger for their souls as the Lamia hunger for their blood. The body of the Aluka is a shell itself, harbouring the essences of all the souls they have consumed, and held together by their own soul. When an Aluka is killed this tainted spirit does not fade away, but will linger as a wraith. no longer as potent as its physical self, it still leeches from humans, mainly while they sleep. Aluka Wraiths can only be dispelled by wizards, and are sent to Cheth (the Hell Dimension) where they are consumed by the Darkness itself, and recycled back into the world. They are parasites in the Nether Realm, a true representation of the Darkness, and its hold on the worlds of Light.<br />
<br />
The Aluka are calm and calculating, and very sadistic. They are great warmongers and take what they want. Arrogance is their only true weakness. If you find yourself facing one, my advice is run.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Aluka_History_b_'></a><h3><b>Aluka History</b></h3>
<br />
The Aluka were made before the Lamia. They are the ugly but perfect version of the Children of the Darkness. They are strong, they are intelligent and they are evil. They protect the Lamia, the fairer version of the race of Undead and Vampyre and humour their petty needs, especially that of the nobles. But they know that the Aluka are the pure race of Darkness and have the power that the Lamia believe is theirs. The Aluka guard the gates to the Other Worlds and command the legions of <a title="demons" href='demons.html' class='wiki'>demons</a> and creatures that come forth through the gates. The Aluka generals are very high up in the Hierarchy of Minions.<br />
<br />
The generals work with the higher ranking Lamia, and assist the armies of darkness, but have their own agenda, always.<br />
<br />
They fewer in number then the Lamia, but their army of thousands is more dangerous and formidable then an army of one hundred thousand men and elves and dwarves. They do not take prisoners, they know no mercy, and they are preparing to cover the Nether Realm in darkness and bring the races of the origins to their knees in submission.<br />
