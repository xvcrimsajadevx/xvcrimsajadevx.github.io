When building a character choosing what <a title="Races" href='Races.html' class='wiki'>Races</a> you want to be is the best start. The Nether Realm has a wide array of races (unfortunately the privilege  to make an original race is reserved for members). Once you have chosen your race (reading everything about them) make sure you adhere to the rules of the world, of magic and of the race society. Questions are welcomed, and utilizing this wiki's search engine is advisable. Every race has its limitations and choosing where to place your character in the world is important too.<br />
<br />
<ul><ul><li>Search this wiki (which contains everything from Arcemedes Library)
</li><li>Ask questions in the help forums
</li><li>Do not worry about writing a novel for your application. We do not have posting minimums for profiles or IC posts but we do ask that for main characters that we have at least a couple of decently sized paragraphs for personality and history, and a good sized paragraph for your characters appearance. Of course if you wish to write a huge profile we do not discourage this. For any profile all we ask is that you make the character fit into our world, the longer the profile, the more chance there is that we may ask for more edits. Saying that we do not get mad if you have not read everything in the library, as long as you don't mind inaccuracies being pointed out and being asked to edit or clarify.

When building a character, be patient with the application process. Just because you have had one character accepted does not mean you will automatically have others accepted. We treat every application as if its from a new member, whether its a veteran of the board, or a staff member, everyone gets treated equally.<br />

<a name='_b_What_are_Main_Minor_and_Basic_Profiles_b_'></a><h1><b>What are Main, Minor and Basic Profiles</b></h1>
<br />
This is often a question that gets asked and as this is the character creation centre I am posting a copy of the updated definitions here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Main_Characters_b_'></a><h2><b>Main Characters</b></h2>
This is a character with a FULL PROFILE. This means every field must be filled in to a good standard, accurately, and of a decent length that you will find at most intermediate to advanced boards. ALL members MUST have a Main Character as their first character. Any characters after this initial full profile can be minor or main. Main characters can be anything, there are no limits on powers, items, status, or race. However the appearance, personality and history must be of a good standard and not simply small, single paragraphs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Minor_Characters_b_'></a><h2><b>Minor Characters</b></h2>
Only those with a main character can apply for a minor one. Generally these kinds of characters have less of a history and personality and are not played as often as main characters. These profiles are for characters with a supporting role, and generally do not have high status (that of a king/leader/general) and are not super powerful or excelling in any ability or possessing of a fantastic item or weapon. Some races are not allowed as minor characters, but if you inquire we may make exceptions. Such races are Magi, Quasi, Shual, and Oracles. Member created races are allowed to have minor characters in positions of power as these races are non canon to the board.<br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: This type of profile is not an excuse to make a shoddy profile and get it accepted, or even for the lazy RPer, it is not there to be abused and still has to be accepted and moved to the right forum before you can RP. It is easier to get accepted as they are more basic characters and less complicated by nature, but you must still RP in a character account.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Basic_Characters_b_'></a><h2><b>Basic Characters</b></h2>
These are glorified NPC's, someone with a name and race but do not need to be RPed in a separate character account. List these Basic Characters in your identity thread and active characters but play them in your own NPC account. These do not need to be accepted and these profiles are not mandatory, they are merely a reference for players if they play a person for a prolonged period. Again, the same rules apply for basic characters as they do minors, they cannot be super powerful, important positions or canons or integral to the world plot. They are simply characters, a name and face is all, and the profile is not mandatory, but purely optional.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, mains and minors need character accounts, and basics are RPed in NPC accounts (like The NPC Byrd, for instance) or your master account as long as you do not post anything else other then NPC's IC with it.<br />
<br />
If you are lost and you have never RPed here before then simply apply for a MAIN CHARACTER as no other type will be accepted from a new member.<br />
<br />
If you wish to apply for a minor or basic and are still confused about their roles then ask in the help forum or the cbox, or PM a member of staff.<br />
