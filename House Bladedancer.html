<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
House Bladedancer was once a higher noble house of Clan Tiaot'n but fell from grace many centuries ago. It was defeated by a house from an outside clan and lost its place and riches in OE society. It has a tradition in producing the finest blade masters in OE society and many OE's secretly trained with their blade masters and experts.<br />
<br />
More recently its name garnered some respect and nobility when one of their daughters, Ilshara was chosen as an Adair of the dragon queen, Tiamat. Her fall from grace was not a surprise though as House Bladedancer has forever failed to deliver. Since her demise and her culling of her own house this lesser noble house of Obsidian Elves has gone underground. Most of the remainder of these elves were annihilated by the Leader of their clan, Lorll, and since then the few who survived the second culling have fled the Forgotten Isles.<br />
