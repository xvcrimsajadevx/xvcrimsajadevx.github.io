<a name='_b_Obsidian_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Obsidian Elves</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
<b>Region:</b> Forgotten Isles<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
They can change their appearance so they can look like other elves (the mimic ability), the only thing they cannot change is their eyes. <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> have a trademark pinprick of a purple glow in the midnight pools of darkness. To the untrained eye they appear no different from other elves when they are in this guise. Whenever they leave the Forgotten Isles they always take on the natural camouflage, one that they have little control over. Only the highest of <a title="Obsidian Elves" href='Obsidian+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Obsidian Elves</a> can control the way others see them.<br />
<br />
Their natural appearance on the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a> is a skin that appears to have a purple tint, their hair either jet black, silver, dark purple or dark green. Their nails black, their long limbs and slender necks make them enchanting even in their true forms. A dark beauty emanates from them, their features not reflecting their black hearts at all. Of course not all Obsidian Elves are evil, but when you are brought up in a culture dominated by <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a>, it is hard to be anything but the malcontent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Born evil, those that do turn to the light are few and far between. Malicious, sadistic, deceptive and cruel, the <a title="obsidian elves" href='obsidian+elves.html' class='wiki'>obsidian elves</a> would kill their own kin to further their own reputation and power.<br />
<br />
There is an innate hatred and jealousy for other alamia in the hearts of the obsidian. Even they they rejected (and for the most part continue to reject) their creator <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, they still harbour a petty jealousy of those the origin now favours. They hate all races of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, and because of their alliance with the Dark Kindreds they also despise dragons.<br />
<br />
An Obsidian elf has no loyalty to blood or clan, they continuously seek to improve their own status and dispose of anyone who gets between them and their goals. They are devious, untrustworthy and maligned,. They may fight under the banner of the Darkness and their armies are formidable, but their petty infighting makes it impossible fr them to be successful in keeping a foothold anywhere of consequence in the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
Their repressed need to want to be accepted by their former brethren has meant they have evolved a mimic ability. It is a natural talent fr blending in with the other alamia on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Other Obsidian Elves can tell apart one of their own from a normal alamia even when their brother or sister is using this ability. They see them for some part as they truly are. The mimic ability does not stop at appearance alone. They can also change their vices and even mimic certain elven majicks. This is why the Obsidian's are able t infiltrate Lenal and are able to sustain a dangerous resistance upon that small continent.<br />
<br />
As with all things there are opposites. There is a rebellion within the Obsidian Elf society also. Some Obsidian's choose to follow the Light and seek to be reunited with Titan. These rebels call themselves 'The Lost', and have quite different personality types/traits to their brethren. Meditative, and often suppressors of their sorcerer powers - adept in healing majicks and wielding weaponry; entire clans are thought to belong the The Lost, but because of the nature of this kind of resistence their numbers are a mystery.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h2><b>History:</b></h2>
<br />
The wars and betrayals of these elves are many, most of which are recorded in their time-lines and historical texts. Yet, none mention the truth of their origins.<br />
<br />
The sixth alamia were the last to awaken in the Alumi Grove<a href="" title="Create page: Alumi+Grove"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. They were the youngest elves, and their Elders awoke in shadow... the newly formed suns of the Nether Realm were already setting and the world was suffused in shadow and doubt. Already their brethren were gathered around the Rock of Ages and were conversing with their creator. The Obsidian elders did not approach <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, and refused to learn the majicks their Origin wanted to teach them. They sought the shadows beyond the mountains and rejected the paths their brethren chose before them.<br />
<br />
They were also the first to murder.<br />
<br />
Cast out by <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> and stripped of their immortality the Obsidian Elves fled Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and sought the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> their black hearts craved.<br />
<br />
The place where these Elders first set foot upon the Dark Continent<a href="" title="Create page: Dark+Continent"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is where the Onyx City<a href="" title="Create page: Onyx+City"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> now stands. Here they were changed and given a new type of immortality. Their souls were bound to Oblivion and fused with the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>. A twisted version of what they once were, still possessing the beauty of the elves but cursed with a tainted soul, they became an adopted race of the Darkness.<br />
<br />
A complex and feudal society evolved upon the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a>, the Dark Kindreds and the Obsidian Elves allying to create the most ferocious and terrible army of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> the worlds had ever known...<br />
<br />
<br />
0E - The Making of the Elves<br />
<br />
- The Sundering of the Elves. Sub-races of elves were formed - these Alamia took on unique characteristics and traits depending on which part of nature they aligned themselves with. Some Alamia remain closer to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> than others, such as the Mountain and Forest elves whilst other such as the Ice elves segregated themselves completely from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
-The last elves awaken, these being what come to be known as the Obsidian Elf Elders. Waking in the evening of Existence, they are the last elves to awaken in Alumi.<br />
<br />
1E-The Darkness curses the elves with the Fading; they are no longer truly immortal.<br />
<br />
-The Dark Sundering.<br />
-The Obsidian Elf Elders are cast out of Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Cut off from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>, severed from him the moment the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> tainted them, these Dark Elves seek their new masters in the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a>, in the north of the Nether Realm.<br />
<br />
From this moment, the moment when <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> severs them from his immortality all those who are born Dark Elves are severed from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. Only the half breeds have fully escaped this fate.<br />
<br />
9E- The Obsidian Elves populate the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a>. They fight amongst themselves and are wild and uncivilised.<br />
<br />
509E- The Onyx city<a href="" title="Create page: Onyx+city"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> in the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a> is made for the Obsidian Elves by the thirteen Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> also organize the Obsidian Elves and set teachers over them to school them in Sorcery<a href="" title="Create page: Sorcery"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, teaching them to control the powers they have wielded for over half a century. These are the first Grand Masters of Sorcery. A hierarchy and aristocracy is established, the Onyx city<a href="" title="Create page: Onyx+city"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> being the capital and where the leader of the Obsidian Elves resides.<br />
<br />
678E- <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> secretly breeds her Dark kindred and allies herself with the Obsidian Elves. A symbiotic relationship is established between the two races; such abilities as speaking with each other telepathically develop.<br />
<br />
760E- After <a title="Tiamat" href='Tiamat.html' class='wiki'>Tiamat</a> is captured the Obsidian Elves have responsibility of breeding and rearing the Dark kindred.<br />
<br />
1999E- Obsidian Elves battle with the vampyres<a href="" title="Create page: vampyres"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> over slave trading and piracy. War lasts for five hundred years.<br />
<br />
2367E- The Elf <a title="Abraxis" href='Abraxis.html' class='wiki'>Abraxis</a> becomes the Obsidian Elf leader. He takes possession of the Onyx Tower, which is the central spire in the Onyx City.<br />
<br />
3100E- A Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> known only as Obscurum attacks Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> with and army of Obsidian Elves . . . There numbers were not many but many elves die in the conflict. <a title="Dwindledwell" href='Dwindledwell.html' class='wiki'>Dwindledwell</a> is laid to ruin.<br />
<br />
5600E- The Obsidian Elves launch an attack on Aether<a href="" title="Create page: Aether"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. Aether<a href="" title="Create page: Aether"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is utterly destroyed. The <a title="Quasi" href='Quasi.html' class='wiki'>Quasi</a> become a nomadic people.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h2><b>Magic:</b></h2>
<br />
These elves are very unique with their magic and very different from true elves. They have all the Shadow Powers, and a very good mastery of telekinisis. All Obsidian Elves are born with the ability to use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>, but cannot use <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. They are elves in look and name only, cast off and cut of from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> altogether. They are masters of Necromancy, whatever school of Sorcery they choose ALL Obsidian Elves are made to master the Death Majicks.<br />
<br />
So their basic majicks are;<br />
<br />
MIMIC<br />
DEATH MAJICKS<br />
SHADOW POWERS -<br />
<br />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<br />
SORCERY<br />
<br />
As they are born <a title="sorcerers" href='sorcerers.html' class='wiki'>sorcerers</a> they can also learn spells in all the schools of . Some Dark Elves even go to House Lightsbane to be trained, but most train on the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a> as the Obsidians have their own Grand Masters in Sorcery. The Obsidian speciality is death magic, and many are fully trained necromancers - it is mandatory for all to have a few death majicks mastered, this is taught in infancy (increasing the chances of these elves to be malign and therefore fewer turn to the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>).<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Other_b_'></a><h2><b>Other:</b></h2>
<br />
Obsidian Elves reside on an island south of the Forgotten Isle<a href="" title="Create page: Forgotten+Isle"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Obsidian Elves are not a true race of Darkness, but rather an adopted race. The Eldest of them remember the Awakening in the Alumi Grove<a href="" title="Create page: Alumi+Grove"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and they remember Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> in the beginning. The Sundering is where the Obsidian Elves started to become what they now are. A handful of elves were drawn towards the <a title="Forgotten Isles" href='Forgotten+Isles.html' class='wiki'>Forgotten Isles</a> and it is here the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> Sundered them completely from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>.<br />
<br />
They are the sixth &quot;alamia&quot; but not acknowledged by Elves as Children of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. They have evolved beyond the other &quot;alamia&quot; and are now dark elves who serve the <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> only.<br />
<br />
They are elves by name and appearance only, the Obsidian Elves refer to themselves as 'Atria Cruora', which in their tongue means 'dark blood'. They have been severed from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> by the powers of <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> and cannot use earth magic at all. As Minions of Darkness and former children of the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a> they can masquerade as normal Elves, when they go outside of the Forsaken Isles<a href="" title="Create page: Forsaken+Isles"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
Imbued with the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> by one of the Thyrza<a href="" title="Create page: Thyrza"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, some believe it to have been a <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a>, all Obsidian Elves are trained in sorcery. The First Obsidian Elves who turned had to endure the painful change of having the ability to use the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a> burned into them, but their children and their children's children are born with that gift and from the womb can command the Primal Power of the <a title="Ether" href='Ether.html' class='wiki'>Ether</a>; the only Race of an Origin<a href="" title="Create page: Origin"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> that can do so.<br />
<br />
Dark majicks are in their blood and they are born sorcerers.<br />
