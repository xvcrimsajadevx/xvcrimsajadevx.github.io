<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Uphaz is bejewelled and adorned in gold and gems, his sceptre is gold, he is crowned in gold and rubies, even his robes are golden silks and chiffon. He appears an old man, not ancient and looking very strong, but his hair is white and his skin wrinkled. He has lofted himself above humans and has proclaimed himself a King and God. The only thing not human in his appearance is the Djinns trademark glowing eyes. His are golden, like everything else about him.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
Even his temples are made of gold. More reminiscent to a palace then a temple. They are very opulent and extremely gregarious.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Uphaz can generate wealth amongst his followers. He can turn anything into gold and jewels, silver, even mithril. A little used power, and very much a waste, he can create new metals and imbue them with magical attributes. He supplies Toah with many metals for his legendary weapons, but always at a price.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Uphaz adores worship and has a Temple of gold in the heart of Avalon. It is an eyesore and a sacrilege, as he built it upon the Nexus, the convergence of the powers...<br />
