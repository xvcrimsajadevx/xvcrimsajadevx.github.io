The Broken might name a Black Guard as a Bull. The name comes from what they are, these warriors do not stop, the continue until death devours them, or when their mission is complete. The Broken are fast, and deadly. They master both melee combat and necromancy. Click the link for an image.<br />

A secret organization founded by Ysuran Blackfury a few decades ago. There is no exact date or time of the founding. These Broken seek to destroy the current Obsidian government, and cut their bond to the Darkness. These Obsidians want to regain the independence of their race. In these few months they have been planning on retaking Onyx City, slaughtering the heretics who do not accept melee combat or the guidance of the Light. And at this point it is revealed that these Obsidians also seek for the guidance of the Light, and are training on healing spells and Light Majick. They also honour Toah as the great Blacksmith.<br />

<a name='_b_Magic_b_'></a><h1><b>Magic:</b></h1>
<br />
 Necromancy and Death Majick, also the new art of Bladesinging: Channelling spells through cold steel on to their foe. Also, the greatest and most powerful enchantment the Obsidian are allowed to wield, is the Maelstrom Lighting. The lighting is a purple blast, launched from the caster, or channelled through the caster's weapon. The lighting burns it's target, and also drains the life force out of them. It is powerful, but can be very exhausting. Some of their most well-crafted weapons can wield up to Two enchantments.<br />
