They are quick learners and often have an affinity with water because it reflects their personalities.<br />
<br />
For a wizard water is life, it nourishes and protects, it is flexible and can be ice, or steam or fluid. For a sorcerer it is death, it can drown, batter with its waves and be ice daggers and spears that pierce the heart. When a hydro-mancer becomes magi, it is usually because they are becoming as water, flowing between spells and constantly changing from one to the next. They are inconstant and soon find themselves consumed by the element they wield so fluidly.<br />
