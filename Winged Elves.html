<a name='_b_Winged_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Winged Elves</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Region:</b> They live in the hidden city which they call Yaenara<a href="" title="Create page: Yaenara"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, and on Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> (mostly on Mount Oleta<a href="" title="Create page: Mount+Oleta"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and in the City of <a title="Amaris" href='Amaris.html' class='wiki'>Amaris</a>)<br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
The male winged elves have black feathered wings and the females have white feathered wings. They are thin and tend to be smaller then the average elf, around 5'4'' in height. Their bones are hollow so they are very light and they are quite fragile really, but the hollow bones allow them aid in flight. This fragile nature means they physically weak and easily broken, but this is balanced out by faster healing and skill in <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>'s healing spells.<br />
<br />
Winged elves braid their hair and bead them, tying the braids back when they fly; although this started as a way of accommodating flight it soon become ritualistic and a means of identifying those Winged Elves who had come of age. Their petite frames are covered by thin material of tight fitting clothing that again is made smaller to accommodate their wings and not hamper them while flying. The priests and priestesses are the only ones who wear anything resembling robes, as they do not travel as much by air and so their wings are able to be more encumbered.<br />
<br />
Elven runes are embroidered onto their clothes, reflecting the tattoos that they mark their skin with. Facial tattoos amongst those with noble blood is most common. This alamia have small, delicate hands and feet, their feet remain unshod as their main means of travelling is by air. The female winged elves often wear ankle jewellery that to some other alamia seems very tribal and primal.<br />
<br />
Their wings have a span that is significantly smaller then the Alatus, as the elves are much smaller - so are their wings. The span varies depending on the individual elf's height, normally their wingspan is twice their own height. The joints of the wings start just below their shoulder blades, the soft feathers disguising the fact that these wings are very flexible and strong.<br />
<br />
They have eyes of varying hues that sparkles like the stars, set in a delicate face. Their rosebud lips often have a friendly yet shy smile upon them, lighting up their petite faces. Other alamia believe that the winged elves are the most precious among them of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>'s children and seek to protect them fiercely, believing they are too weak and fragile to protect themselves. The winged elves sparkling eyes are believed to be a remnant of the Light that was bestowed upon the elves at the Awakening. This alamia were the only ones to retain this gift from <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> after the first Sundering.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
They are philosophers and sometimes dreamers, and have the ability to read aura's. This can vary in information, some can tell the future, some the health and some the hidden talents of the person. Most winged elves are wary of strangers as they fear betrayal and discovery. Only really trusting of the Thunderdrake dragons, who are like themselves hunted, the Winged Elves are a quiet and delicate people. They are very spiritual and love looking to the stars for comfort. Star gazing and reading is a favourite past time and it is not unusual to see a winged elf with their head craned to the skies, a small smile upon their face, a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
Not confrontational in nature and very easy going, they often find that they are overwhelmed by others and talked over by stronger personalities. Content to sit back and observe and listen they give great insight into people.<br />

<br />
Not a lot is known about the winged elves. They were made before the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a> (many believe that <a title="Tempest" href='Tempest.html' class='wiki'>Tempest</a>'s aiding in their evolution made her want a winged race of her own, which then led her to the creation of the <a title="Alatus" href='Alatus.html' class='wiki'>Alatus</a>) and are much rarer then even the Water Elves. They are close allies of the <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a>, and reside with them in the mountains. Their home remains hidden and nothing more then legend now, to those outside of the Elven Race.<br />
