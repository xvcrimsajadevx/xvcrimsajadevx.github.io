<br />
<b>Name:</b> The Province of Yaquinta<br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b> North west of Avalon, on the south western border of Sedana.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Major_towns_cities_or_landmarks_b_'></a><h1><b>Major towns,cities or landmarks:</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='_b_Capital_Taylua_b_'></a><h2><b>Capital- Taylua:</b></h2>
<br />
This city is the only city in Yaquinta. Here the people gather for festivals and celebrations. There is no class system, so there are no manors or estates. The city has many buildings, but they are all either shops or taverns. Their is no currency as all of the inhabitants trade with goods, or do each other favours. The city is the hub of trade and has many market days. The architecture is simple, stone white buildings and a central square where there is a stature of the three light bearers, and a fountain. A House for the Light Bearer's is situated to the north of the city, but it is rarely occupied. Volunteers keep it clean and tend the gardens, waiting for the return of the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>.<br />
<br />
Landmark - Ivory Tower: There are no beaches or accessible coastlines in Yaquinta, but high cliffs that are impossible to climb. Even flying races, and those that are minions are dealt with in the skies by the White Knights. The Ivory Tower can be seen from the ocean in the west, and is the only landmark that can be seen from outside of the province. It is pristine white, and extremely high, with only one balcony at the top, and one door at the bottom. Only the Light Bearer Aurora<a href="" title="Create page: Aurora"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> can grant entry, and one can only enter if she occupies the tower.<br />
<br />

<a name='_b_Synopsis_of_Country_Region_b_'></a><h1><b>Synopsis of Country/Region:</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
The province of Yaquinta is on the southern coast of <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a>, and the far west of Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. It is a small land with one major city, Taylua. The main landmark is a castle built for Aurora<a href="" title="Create page: Aurora"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> by the <a title="Mountain Elves" href='Mountain+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Mountain Elves</a> of the Gallian Mountains.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of small villages and farms make up the rest f the province. It is a tranquil land, a place of reflection, meditation, and peace.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_People_of_Yaquinta_b_'></a><h1><b>The People of Yaquinta:</b></h1>
<br />
They are peaceful, meditative and spiritual, and mostly descendants of Gallian. There are other races present, but they are mainly travellers and stay in the city's taverns.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
<br />
It is an independent state, but was once a part of <a title="Sedana" href='Sedana.html' class='wiki'>Sedana</a>. Great magic protects its borders and the White Knights of Yaquinta make up its army. The White Knights are not human, and some believe they are not even alive... few know the truth. The only leader of note is the Light Bearer Aurora<a href="" title="Create page: Aurora"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. She was protected by her White Knights for many centuries within the borders of her province. It was her birthplace when it was part of Sedana, and through her became and independent state. Not much is known of its politics, as few enter uninvited and those that do are trusted and made to keep its secrets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
The people f this land worship the <a title="Light" href='Light.html' class='wiki'>Light</a>. The type of worship is similar to the ancient traditions of Gallian, and as most of the inhabitants are descendants of those survivors, these traditions and culture is/are maintained. They have a holy day where they attend the Ivory Tower and pay tribute to the Light and the Light Bearers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
The White Knights of Yaquinta are the law enforcers. In the mists they dispose of anyone who is a dark minion. No one can get past them, they know all who serve the Darkness. How they know is a mystery, but some believe they can see into peoples hearts and minds, and they judge them accordingly.<br />
<br />
The only law that is punishable by death is that f being a Dark Minion. Murderers are simply exiled and never allowed to return. All other crime (and there is little crime because the place is a Haven) is dealt with by the Judges, who are voted for by the residents f this province.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
Yaquinta is fully self sufficient. There is no currency, everything is bartered.<br />
