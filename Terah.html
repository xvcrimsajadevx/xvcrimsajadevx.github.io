<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
She is mist and cloud, never really there, but sometimes the shape of a woman can be made out. She can make herself corporeal, but only does so with the Alatus Empress and her lover and children. Her hair is always white mist, and her eyes a beautiful silver glow. Her face is youth and beauty eternal.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
Her temples are all the same, the largest being in Volatilis. There it is near the Palace of the Four Winds, connected to the Palace island tower by a huge thin silver bridge. The temple itself is on a perfectly round floating isle, which is a circle of stone pillars, with no roof and a single pedestal in the centre.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Terah can command the winds, her powers not unlike Tempests (except the Djinn wields the same spells using the Ether she herself is made from), which is why the Origin adopted her as her namesake while she grieved her beloved dragons. Terah never abuses her powers and will serve Tempest until the end of time. She does not get caught up in the other conflicts between the Djinn, and has removed herself from most of their company. She speaks only with Morrigan, Eleph and Ezia.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Terah is one of the true Goddess of the Alatus, asked by Tempest to look after her second born, and raised up as their goddess. She is the mother of that race, the father being the first Alatus made by Tempest. But she rarely visits her temple in Volatilis now. Having taken Alatus men for lovers for thousands of years and weeping when they died (Alatus are not immortal), she could bear it no longer. So she chose to reside with the Winged Elves in their secret city, and take a mate from their longer living race. She has born two children with this Winged Elf, but their identities are secret.<br />
<br />
Terah returns to the temple in Volatilis whenever she is summoned by her people. Those who visit her in her temple are always given the help they plead for.<br />
