Sorcerers are aligned with evil. Only humans can be sorcerers. The ability to use the Ether is inborn and cannot be learnt. This ability can manifest itself at any age. Sorcerers have very long lifespans and stop aging at whatever age pleases them. Therefore a sorcerer can look 15, or 150, their appearance matters not. A 15 year old looking sorcerer could actually be 2000 years old.<br />
<br />
The ability to use the ether is fading out amongst humans. Fewer humans with the ability to tap into the Ether are being born.<br />
<br />
In some human cultures a spell is performed to suppress this ability. Some people may have had this spell cast upon them at a very young age, but because of this spell, never knew they were a magical being.<br />
<br />
Most sorcerers are former wizards, or young magic users who have not trained that are apprenticed by sorcerers.<br />
