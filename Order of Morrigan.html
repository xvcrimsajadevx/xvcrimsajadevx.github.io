<br />
<br />
<b>RACE: </b> Only humans see the Djinn as gods, therefore only humans would worship Morrigan in this way. It is rare for members of other races to join this group, but it is not impossible. As Morrigan is the Djinn of war there are more members of her cult from other races then the average Djinn.<br />
<br />
<b>COUNTRY/REGION:</b> The Order are found mainly in the Temples of Morrigan, but they do have safe houses around the world from which they recruit people. The temples are all over the world, and known by most people. There is only one that is hidden and only the highest members of the Order know its location as it is where Morrigan dwells.<br />
<br />
<b>LIFESPAN:</b> Depends on the race and magic of the Cult Member.<br />
<br />
<b>APPEARANCE:</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Her Priestesses mimic her appearance as dark maidens with raven hair and blood red garments. All Priestesses look similar, their race being the only definitive differences. They all dress in black hooded cloaks and red slashed dresses, their pale skin exposed. Some mistake them for Vampires<a href="" title="Create page: Vampires"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>. The Knights dress in Crimson armour, always. The Maidens in simple black and red dresses and the Disciples in black garments.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>PERSONALITY TRAITS:</b><br />
<br />
The Priestesses are strict, tough and sometimes rather arrogant. They are powerful beings and often use their magic to get their point across. The Knights are obedient, subservient and loyal to the Order. The Maidens and the Disciples are always trying to look good in front of those ranked above them, in the hope that one day they may dwell among their god also and receive those divine gifts.<br />
<br />
<b>HISTORY:</b><br />
<br />
<a title="Morrigan" href='Morrigan.html' class='wiki'>Morrigan</a> has always been and has always welcomed worship. She chose her first Priestess from amongst the female warriors of <a title="Eraosia" href='Eraosia.html' class='wiki'>Eraosia</a> and has chosen many from that country since. She is worshipped as much as <a title="Uphaz" href='Uphaz.html' class='wiki'>Uphaz</a> in that country, but Teran's and Adenian's also share this worship. War appeals to many and it does you good to have the Djinn of War on your side.<br />
<br />
For centuries the Order has been open and never changed. The last 50 years though <a title="Morrigan" href='Morrigan.html' class='wiki'>Morrigan</a> has not allowed any new members into her Order and the Priestesses have disappeared. The Knights have not been seen in battle for 145 years and the temples have shut their gates. None go in or out of the Black Temples of Morrigan and Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> is starting to forget their ever was a <a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> of War.<br />
<br />
<b>MAGIC:</b><br />
<br />
They can have premonitions of a warrior's violent death, they can command and summon Banshee's and can influence the tide of war. Their touch can imbue people with fury and the battle fever. Unlike their goddess they are not warriors. they are protected by the Knights though, as they are still mortal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>EXTRA INFO:</b><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
All of the below positions tend to the discipline, worship, and the training of the acolytes, porters, and lector's.<br />

Acolyte - Brand new students in the Order of Morrigan<br />
<br />
Acolyte's do not have to ascend through the temple one step at a time, usually they skip porter or lector rank, it only depends on the archpriest's decision. It can take a very long time to become an arhcpriest or higher. Their positions can be challenged as this is a temple of war. Anyone can challenge anyone's position except for the Prelate, Patriarch, Exarch, or Metropolitan. These can be challenged but only directly through Morrigan. She requires to oversee these sorts of challenges and must approve the challenge.<br />
