<br />
Kurn is a city state. North east of the ice continent, this is an awesome construction of giants, carved out of the Kurnia Mountains by the ice giants of old. For a hume or humanoid the sheer size of the place is overwhelming, the steps to their main temple are ten to twenty feet high, the giants themselves being around fifty feet on average. The grey and white of the stone and ice makes this place a foreboding place. The caves dug out of the mountainsides are the abodes of the few remaining ice giants. The centre of the city is not populated often, but the odd giant is roaming around and will tread upon anyone who is not welcome there. The <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a> are often visitors, and trade with the giants who mine the great mountains ranges all over the continent for them in exchange for what, no one but the ice elves know.<br />

<br />
The Vallumglaciar<a href="" title="Create page: Vallumglaciar"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> was built to keep the ice giants out and away from the humes they hate so much. Often they will bash the sides of the great ice walls and attempt to break it, but its magics hold strong and have done for over a millennia. The ice wastes on the outside or the realm of the ice giants and Silvermyst <a title="Dragons" href='Dragons.html' class='wiki'>Dragons</a>. They steer clear of one another most of the time, neither seeing it as a good idea to make war, as they are pretty evenly matched in battle. Few humes or elves live outside of the Vallumglacier but those that do tend to have settlements far from the ice giants roaming. Building in deep valleys the giants cannot enter and hiding themselves away so as not to draw attention to themselves.<br />

<br />
Kratak is the recognised leader of the ice giants. He came by the title of Kurr by murdering the last leader. This is normally how 'power' changes hands. The only thing the Kurr really does is direct the giants were to mine and meet with the Ice Elves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
No religion. Even though they are a race of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> they have little magic and no belief system. They have few rituals, most surrounding the rising of the sun, and the moon and their mating rituals which are violent at best, and homicidal at worst.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
None.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
The only currency is the secrets they have with the <a title="Water Elves" href='Water+Elves.html' class='wiki'>Water Elves</a>. The only trade is with the ice elves, and sometimes other individuals who decide to visit the far reaches of the ice continent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Extra_Info_b_'></a><h1><b>Extra Info:</b></h1>
<br />
There are no more then three thousand ice giants at the present time. There is very little mating, and giant pregnancies last for fifty years. The young rarely survive the cold climates or the destructive nature of the giants.<br />
