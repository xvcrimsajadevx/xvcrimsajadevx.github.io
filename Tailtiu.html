<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
A delicate humanoid looking creature, Tailtiu is the Queen of the Tuatha, her Faery. She is sworn protector of them and has made a haven for them on a secret island of the east coast of Avalon. She is a giant sized faery herself, although only appearing like a small woman to humans, she has faery wings and is the most beautiful of all the Djinn.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
The Faery Circles in all the ancient forests are her temples. Omri made those groves for her and her precious faery.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
As queen of the faeries her powers are even now a mystery. Some believe Tailtiu to be an Eria, as it is said she always comes to whoever calls her in need, or sends her faeries in her stead.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Anger her or harm her fairies and she becomes wrathful. She can turn and become a dark entity, which is the main reason she secludes herself from other races. She is naive, trusting and easily hurt and vengeful when hurt.<br />
