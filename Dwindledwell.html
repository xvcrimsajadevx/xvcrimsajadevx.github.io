Once a thriving metropolis of forest elves surrounded by the beautiful Caryssa Forest, the trees are now bare and dying, the forests silent, and the city a necropolis. A sad air resonating, a sense of loss echoes on the wind and makes a traveller move on instead of dwindle...<br />
<br />
Hunted and cursed by its past, with eerie whispers of the dead on the cold wind. Remnants of legend lye hidden in its depths, forgotten by the elves, and purged from the memories of the forest elf alamia - who refuse to speak of it or even whisper its name. Even the young elves on Lenal do not dare to go there. There are no stories that are told to scare them at night, no record of its past for them to fear; only their parents refusal to acknowledge and their own fear in their hearts and the look on their parents faces when the pass the edges of the Caryssa Forest to warn them that it is forbidden.<br />
<br />
The city and entire area is wild, the vines strangle and break the stone of the buildings; it is as if the earth wants to hide it from the eyes of the world and break it as a punishment for its many sins.<br />
<br />
A single statue remains untouched upon a ridge overlooking the Dwindledwell Valley. The ground is scorched around it, as if someone has made an attempt to destroy the statue. Nothing grows upon this ridge or even in the shadows that the statue casts. It depicts a forest elf, the name scratched out to obscure his identity; his visage untouched, his eyes watching over the cursed land with a malicious grin upon his malevolent face.<br />
<br />
None dare to enter Dwindledwell as no one has known a soul to return from it. The dead own it and they keep it.<br />
