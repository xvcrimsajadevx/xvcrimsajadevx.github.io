<br />
<b>Affiliation</b>: Light<br />
<br />
Wizards are aligned with good. Only humans (and the rare good aligned Obsidian Elf can be wizards. The ability to use the Ether is inborn and cannot be learnt. This ability can manifest itself at any age. Wizards have very long lifespans and stop ageing at whatever age pleases them. Therefore a wizard can look 15, or 150, their appearance matters not. A 15 year old looking wizard could actually be 2000 years old.<br />
<br />
The ability to use the ether is fading out amongst humans. Fewer humans with the ability to tap into the Ether are being born.<br />
<br />
In some human cultures a spell is performed to suppress this ability. Some people may have had this spell cast upon them at a very young age, but because of this spell, never knew they were a magical being.<br />
<br />
Any human found with this ability are offered the chance to study wizardry on the islands. Some are made to go there by their family, some run away and some are recruited by other wizards and made apprentice.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Training_b_'></a><h1><b>Training</b></h1>
<br />
<a name='Basic'></a><h2>Basic</h2>
<br />
Those who choose to train as wizards all do their basic training on the Wizarding Isles in the north of the Nether Realm. The Wizarding Isles are seven islands where young people learn the basics. It is these seven isles (not including Meru as that's the huge island upon which young wizards arrive and mature wizards mingle, have fun and where the main trade and harbour is) where the schools are based.<br />
<br />
When a child (or sometimes adult) arrives on Meru they are assessed by wizards from each school. If their is a talent linked to a certain school then that school takes them to the relevant island. If no talent is discovered then the individual chooses where they wish to train. Those who are weaker in the Ether tend to be encouraged towards Illusion. Those stronger, Divination and Healing. Those who are interested in Battle Majicks often choose Conjuration.<br />
<br />
Once they arrive on their chosen island they are housed with other students (often in small cottages or huge castles and towers). Classes are very relaxed and go at the pace of the learners. Anything between two and two hundred or more years can be spent learning the basic spells of a school. When a learner is ready (which is determined by the learner and the Leader of their school) they have a mentor given to them.<br />
<br />
<a name='Mentors'></a><h2>Mentors</h2>
<br />
Mentors (who normally reside on their island of wizardry or Meru) are sometimes chosen by the leader of the school, but very often a wizard chooses their own apprentice. In a wizards life he/she may teach several apprentices. A mentor does not have to be a master of their school and neither does an apprentice have to have only one mentor. An apprentice can be taught by two mentors from two schools simultaneously (if the student is powerful and promising), but co-operation between schools is almost unheard of. Competition is rife, and talented students argued over.<br />
<br />
The more complicated and intense and advanced training can occur wherever the mentor wishes it to be. They could send them abroad alone (to the Shaman, or other Mages or whoever they think they should train with), travel with them, teach them on the isles, its really up to the mentor how they finish their training.<br />
<br />
The spells of the schools are there to give an idea of basic training, and a wizard can create their own spells from their school (once they have learned the basics on the isles and got a mentor and continue to add to their grimoire if they are so inclined), and learn those of his/her mentor. There is a lot of variation and freedom regarding training, even the initial training on the isles a young wizard can specialise, generalise or focus on their talents (Seer, Conjurer, Healer, Magic Sword Maker, Aeromancer, etc).<br />
<br />
<a name='Elemental'></a><h2>Elemental</h2>
<br />
Wizards generally discourage delving into elemental majick, but as some individuals have no choice in this regard (because of their Talent) there is a school upon Meru where wizards can learn to control the pull of the elementals. They are taught the basic survival majciks, taught how to control the elemental force within them and stop them from becoming Magi. This school is rarely spoken of and not somewhere most desire to go. Beyond this basic training there is nothing else. If a wizard wishes to explore their element then they have to search elsewhere, or take the chance in discovering it themselves. This, of course, is also discouraged as the risk of Magi is high in these circumstances. Some will seek out humes who specialise in elemental majick, such as the Children of the Waves, so they can develop their elemental spells.<br />
<br />
Elemental wizards are generally looked upon with disdain and deemed as insane and freaks. The state of Magi is deeply feared and those who choose to risk it are seen as crazy and weird. Most elemental wizards are therefore quite separated from the wizarding community and often loners, which is a major reason why they tend not to stick with their school of training, and seek other ways to master their element.<br />
