Old man justice. The Judge and the Jury, Zadok appears as a wizened old man, the scales of Justice balancing on his sceptre. The only thing Djinn about his, is of course....his white glowing eyes, white that reflects his hair and beard and robes. Larger then most humans he sits as still as statue on his judgement seat in Sedana.<br />

<b>Temples:</b><br />

His temples are precise pieces of architecture, all angles and steps and pillars. His sigil of the scales are carved into every flat stone, every tile. This temple is typical of Sedanaian architecture and mimicked throughout the land, Although the temple is not replicated the style is copied. Sedana's grand cathedrals have similar architecture to this temple. The style is characterized by heavy masonry construction with narrow openings, features such as a round arch for the doorways, a groin vault and barrel vault, the vaulting rib, the vaulting shaft, and central and western towers whose roofs disappear into the clouds.<br />

It is located in the centre of Lake Tedosa and is accessed by a boat which is unmanned and only takes one person at a time.<br />
<br />
An enormous statue of Zadok sits on his throne in a massive, high ceilinged and cavernous. Only to his priests will he always answer... it is rare for him to speak to pilgrims. When he does they are always alone and the statue comes to life.<br />
