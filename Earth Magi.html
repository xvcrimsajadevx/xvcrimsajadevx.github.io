Wizard’s who have an affinity with the earth are normally of a stubborn nature and fascinated with how the world works. Their delving into the mysteries of the world often results in frustration. Many are adept Alchemists too and friendly with dwarves and elves especially. Like the aeromancers, few become magi as the element is tough to master. You have to break through the bedrock and the stubborn earth to learn her mysteries and few have the patience or talent to do so. A great amount of control and skill is required to cause the earth to shake, and it can be at this point, when the wizard is poised between magic’s, that they may become Geo Magi.<br />
