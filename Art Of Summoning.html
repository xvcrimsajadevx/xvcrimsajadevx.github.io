<br />
The Eria are summoned by the Quasi, through the Ether. Summoning is rare amongst the humans of the Nether Realm and in some societies frowned upon. In fact wizards see it as second rate use of the Ether and encourage any youngling with the Talent for using the Ether to choose a life of Wizardry. Summoning bring longevity as does wizardry and sorcery, but it also brings a spiritual connection with the Eria. Not all Eria come through into the Nether Realm, but the Quasi are able to converse with them and touch the Shadow Realm. For this they must go into a deep meditation; which brings us to how summoners actually summon...<br />

<br />
A Quasi must first connect with the Shadow Realm. this is taught to beginners as <i>finding the window</i>. They have to meditate deeply every night in order to relax their body and free their mind. Once they connect with the shadow Realm they can touch the Eria. This process prepares them for the act of the summon. This could take place the next day, or the next minute.<br />
<br />
The second part of summoning requires the Quasi to call to the Eria. This is easily done so and depending on the relationship between summoner and Eria can be done by either vocally calling their name three times, or sending a telelpathic message to the Shadow Realm.<br />
<br />
The Eria comes through the body of the summoner and so we come to how an Eria takes its corporeal form in the Nether Realm.<br />

<br />
The Quasi gasps and doubles over as if suffering a blow to the stomach and then their body convulses, their soul appearing to detach from them slightly; its ethereal essence an aberration from the body. But before it detaches completely, the Eria emerges from the body (coming through the chest), going through the Quasi’s soul and materialises in the Nether Realm. This is a very tumultuous and intense experience for the Quasi and leaves them very weak temporarily; however, the Eria would provide sufficient protection during the summoning so the state of the actual summoner is negligible. But when the Eria returns to the Shadow Realm, and is not there to subsidise the Quasi’s strength, the summoner is left weak and unable to summon until fully recovered - this is dependent on how powerful the respective summoner is.<br />

<br />
How many Eria a Quasi can summon depends on their ability and upon the Eria themselves. Some Eria will refuse to answer the call of certain summoners as well.<br />
<br />
The after effects of summoning leave the summoner weak. This limits the number of times a Quasi can summon in a certain period of time. The stronger the summoner in the Ether and as a person physically the more the often they can summon.<br />

<br />
Different summoners use different summons for different reasons. Some will battle with them, calling upon the likes of Tyra and Naolin. and some will use them to heal or assist them, and summon Eria like Rhiannon and Abeona... A summoner relies on the Eria to use the Ether, so unlike a wizard or sorcerer they cannot use the Ether for everyday things. But through summoning the Eria the force of their spells are ten times that of a wizard, so quantity is not always better then quality. This makes the Quasi good in battle, as once an Eria is brought into the equation their is usually only one winner.<br />
