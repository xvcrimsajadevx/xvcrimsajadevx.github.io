<a name='_b_Primal_Powers_b_'></a><h1><b>Primal Powers</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - What are the Primal Powers?</b><br />
<br />
A. The Primal Powers are the four forces in this world. Some call them magic, others laws of nature. They are: The Light/Creation, The Darkness/Destruction, The Ether/Neutrality, The Origins/Elements.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Humans_and_Ether_b_'></a><h1><b>Humans and Ether</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - What percentage of humes can use the Ether?</b><br />
<br />
A. About 1/100 people in this Realm (the entire hume population) have the Ether Ability and out of those only 1/20 ether users have special Talents (like elemental prowess, Seership, etc). A low percentage of Ether Users become Magi, and few ether users are ever trained. The wizarding isles is only one fifth wizard, the other four fifths are normal humes working on the isles. The rate of people being born with the ether ability is also in decline, having dropped from 1/50 to 1/100 in the last fifty years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Alignment_b_'></a><h1><b>Alignment</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - What does alignment mean?</b><br />
<br />
A. Alignment depends on what magic your character can use. If they are Hume and can use majick they are aligned with the Ether. Light and Dark depends more on personality and beliefs, so if your character is a wizard their alignment will be Light/Ether. Sorcerers are Darkness/Ether. All origin races are aligned with the Origin who created them. Alatus/Tempest, Centaurs/Titan and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_How_is_Majick_used_b_'></a><h1><b>How is Majick used</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - How does the use of magic work here?</b><br />
<br />
A. Every magic user is aligned with a primal power. Their personal use depends on talent, training and the type of primal power they are aligned with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Repercussions_of_use_b_'></a><h1><b>Repercussions of use</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Are their physical repercussions for &quot;overdoing&quot; it?</b><br />
<br />
A. Again, that depends on the Primal Power. The Light and Darkness powers have limitations depending on the Minion/individual.<br />
<br />
For Ether users they simply could not connect to the Ether or complete a spell, the spell would not work if they are too fatigued.<br />
<br />
For Origin races this is not an issue. The Origins flow through them, these magic users are more like conduits for the elements. If there are repercussions per race it is listed in the races information on the wiki. Every race is different when it comes to magic use.<br />
<br />
For example: an Alatus does not have as good a control over the weather as a Dragon, some Alatus can't or won't use magic. Different elven alamia have preferred spells and talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_quot_Burn_Out_quot_b_'></a><h1><b>&quot;Burn Out&quot;</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Can you burn out?</b><br />
<br />
A. Using the Ether takes mental and physical effort, everyone has their threshold and when its breached their spells fail, but you can't burn the ability out of you (unless you become a summoner). You can be too weak to perform magic, that is the limitation. Performing powerful magic drains you as it takes effort to control the Ether. Its why Wizards and other trained magic users are more proficient with magic, they have been trained to know their limits and use spells efficiently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_One_Power_b_'></a><h1><b>One Power</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Is touching the Ether like touching the One Power in The Wheel of Time series?</b><br />
<br />
A. Yes and No. The Ether is similar but Ether users do not create weaves like the Aes Sedai do in WoT. Ether users manipulate the world using the Ether; but touching the Ether is much easier then connecting to the One Power. The Ether is everywhere, its like air for those who have the ability to manipulate it, it is insubstantial but has a function. They do not take the Ether into themselves, only Quasi Summoners do this, and Magi. The ability pokes the ether to do the magic users bidding. Some use their mind to control it, some words/incantations and some hand gestures. There are various techniques outside of wizardry as well, but again, that depends on the type of training.<br />
<br />
The only way it is like the One Power is the fact that Ether users can sense the ability in others. The is no difference between the sexes though, they both have the same talent and use the same 'source'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Wizards_and_Sorcerers_b_'></a><h1><b>Wizards and Sorcerers</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - What happens if a Wizard starts to practice dark majick? And vice versa for Sorcerer's?</b><br />
<br />
A. Any wizard who uses dark magic is well on his way to sorcery. He would switch and no doubt secretly be a sorcerer and pretend to be a Wizard, or he would out himself and proclaim his new allegiance. If he was discovered by Wizards he would be ousted from their craft and circles.<br />
<br />
Remember Wizardry and Sorcery is trained magic users who choose Light or Dark. There are all the shades of grey in both groups, more merciful sorcerers (like Rodgin) and less then altruistic wizards (like Vryant).<br />
<br />
Sorcerers who 'see the light' can become wizards but they would find it hard to be accepted into wizarding society, for obvious reasons (trust issues, etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Wizarding_Councils_b_'></a><h1><b>Wizarding Councils</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Are there any Wizarding Councils/Organizations outside of Meru/The Orbis Veneficus?</b><br />
<br />
A. Yes there are but we have not made them, and members are free to create them. The wizarding isles is the centre of the craft, being the first place Wizards were organised but other groups of organised wizards exist throughout the Realm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Time_needed_to_learn_b_'></a><h1><b>Time needed to learn</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - How long does it take for a Wizard/Sorcerer from each school to master their particular type of majick?</b><br />
<br />
A. For the harder schools (Divination &amp; Healing/Necromancy, Invokation/Evokation, and Conjuration/Decimation) it would be several months in the Institution on Meru to ascertain their talents and school, then a few years of general training in their craft, then between 50 and 500 years being taught by a mentor. These magic users are always learning though. Each individual can master several spells, but be realistic. It is very unusual for a character to be proficient in more then one school and they would either have to learn those crafts alongside each other which would double their learning time, or learn them seperately...<br />
<br />
For sorcery see Lightsbane information. that is the only premade school of sorcery thus far but members are free to establish their own schools of sorcery. Lightsbane is run for the most part by Necromancers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Spell_Mastery_b_'></a><h1><b>Spell Mastery</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - How many spells can my character learn in Wizardry/Sorcery?</b><br />
<br />
A. We prefer that you don't have them as masters of every single spell, and if they are that they are not masters of several schools. You can make up your own spells but we would prefer that around five spells are mastered. If there are more give us a reason, show us why they are so talented. Learning spells can be numerous as they will not necessarily ever master them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Majick_School_Mastery_b_'></a><h1><b>Majick School Mastery</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Can a Wizard/Sorcerer become learned in more than one school?</b><br />
<br />
A. Yes, but the more schools you learn the less spells you can master per school. In some cases if you learn spells in other schools you can NEVER master one school (Invokation and Divination are two such schools.) We do allow exceptions to the rule to allow for individual talent though, just be realistic in your choices or give a very good reason as to why they are so talented.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_New_Spell_Creation_b_'></a><h1><b>New Spell Creation</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Can new spells be invented by members or do I have to use the ones written down already?</b><br />
<br />
A. You can make up your own spells, the ones provided in the wiki are a guide more then anything. We don't mind you using the pre made spells for your profiles though. Just try and stay true to the school. For mage spells you can be as inventive as you please, there is no need to keep to wizarding schools in this case.<br />
<br />
Mage magic is more open then wizards, and there is almost total freedom. The only drawback is wizards are more specialized and more proficient so a wizards fire ball might be more powerful then a mages.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Spell_Countering_b_'></a><h1><b>Spell Countering</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Does one need to be able to touch the Ether to counter a spell?</b><br />
<br />
For example, you may have a character who is just learning that they can cast majick. They can see majick but not actually create any spells.<br />
<br />
If you can see the majick, do they need to cast a spell to counter the spell, or can it be done by just seeing it?<br />
<br />
<br />
A. Simple answer. No. You don't need to be able to touch the ether via a spell to counter a spell.<br />
<br />
A character can have reflex reactions, and auto counter a spell cast. The ether ability is innate and training is not required to use it. Therefore someone just discovering their ability could definitely counter a spell cast on them as a reaction. This is how a lot of ether abilities are discovered, especially by non ether users. In Sedana if a person accidentally uses magic they are discovered and put to death. Talents can be uncovered accidentally to, a child could be drowning and stop themselves by teleporting or parting the water, another person could have a fireball thrown at them and summon a barrier to protect themselves. These are auto reactions, and plausible. Just be sensible with what things they can do. These are reactions and not learned spells, therefore they may not be able to replicate the action, at least perhaps not without training of some kind (by wizards, mages, etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Time_Manipulation_Spells_b_'></a><h1><b>Time Manipulation Spells</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - Tempore: Manipulation of time. Exactly what type of manipulation can be done and how much?</b><br />
<br />
A. The time majicks vary depending on who casts them. The most proficient of Invokation Wizards and the Shaman are able to see the past, present and future by looking into a window they open using their invokation/shaman majicks, or they astral project themselves to that instant in time. Walking through time (otherwise known as time travelling) is reserved for only the most powerful of people, and thus far it is unknown if it has ever been achieved. Thus, we do not accept characters with this ability.<br />
<br />
Manipulating the time line comes via reaching through this window or using the astral self. Some majick users can cause their astral self to be seen by those in the other time frame, and effect events that way, but again this kind of spell must be cleared with staff before a plot is RPed. Other ways to manipulate time are by reaching into the river of time, seen through the window and touching the flow of time. Again, this must be done only when permission has been gained.<br />
<br />
We do not want major alterations in the timeline done often, but smaller alterations, or significant ones that involve the restoration of the timeline can be done with the permission of staff. Just remember to be clear how and when and who are effected. PM staff with details of the alterations you propose. This may sound restrictive but as you must know from reading/watching stories with time fluctuations it has to be exact and controlled otherwise things get confused and out of hand. When you start introducing paradoxes you have to keep it simple.<br />
<br />
Other time majicks include:<br />
<br />
Stopping/speeding up time (this is done by Shamans for the most part and the area effected is only within a certain radius of the shaman). Time slows or quickens within a few feet or sometimes an entire city, depending upon the spell casters strength. A smaller radius for this spell does not need permission in RPs but we suggest you ok it with fellow players before using it. A small radius would be a small campsite for instance (around twenty feet in diameter we would suggest be the limits on this.) As to how often this can be done, it depends on the strength of the individual. Shamans tend to be best at this spell and can on average perform it several time a day in short bursts. Other majick users are limited to around once a day, a few times a week and sometimes only once a week, month or year.<br />
<br />
Teleportation - as time and space are linked (the space/time continuum) teleportation is listed as a time majick. Some majick users have the Talent for teleportation (also listed as a mind majick) and can teleport short distances. For longer distances you need to gain permission. This spell can only be done once a day, even the Thyrza cannot do it more often then that, it is a very powerful ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_Mind_s_Eye_Spell_b_'></a><h1><b>The Mind's Eye Spell</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Q - The spell Mind's Eye says you can, &quot;invoke an object or even a person to appear, just by thinking about it, picturing it in the mind.&quot;</b><br />
<br />
Do simply &quot;see&quot; them with your mind or do they actually come to where you are. If this is the case do you have to know exactly where the person or object is and are there limitations such as distance that apply?<br />
<br />
A. We try to be as ambiguous as we can with limitations as we want there to be scope for the player to make these spells minor or major, mastered or mastering. For a mastered spell Minds Eye would have less limitations and the object could be further and larger, for instance. As its an invokation spell the object quite literally appears, and for a master of this spell they would have to only have seen it before invoking it. the picture has to be something/someone you have already laid eyes upon and is a memory. For someone who has not yet mastered this spell they would indeed have to know where the object is and have seen it recently. For a master it can be a distant memory and no prior knowledge to the current location is required.<br />
<br />
In all instances the picture must be precise, and the wizard must be able to imagine the object for it to appear. This takes great concentration and focus, its a tricky spell indeed.<br />
