<br />
If you take a look at the <a class="wiki"  href="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y126/phoenixbyrd/WorldMapLabelled.jpg">world map</a> you will see there is plenty of ocean where undiscovered islands and small continents can be so feel free to plot new area's, but keep them within reason. As for demon realms and locations within the existing realms the same rules apply. The fields marked with a ** are fields that can be omitted from the demon realm location application. Thank you.<br />
