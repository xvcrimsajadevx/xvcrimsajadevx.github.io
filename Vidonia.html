<br />
The capital of Lenal, the city is set within the province of Sedan in the north easterly region of Elvenhome. They city is spread amidst the Erela Plains. The Rock of Ages looms far in the south west, the harbour city of Naida to the north, and the volcano <a title="Vesta" href='Vesta.html' class='wiki'>Vesta</a> dominating the horizon far to the south.<br />
<br />
Vidonia is the greatest of all Elven Cities and was built to accommodate all alamia. The River Tayce flows from north-west to south east, then further south through the Gap of Vesta, and emptying in the Chandra Sea. The underwater Lake of Alethea is inhabited by the water elves beneath the great city. It is entered via the river which has underwater tunnels branching off from it that then turn into streams that lead to Alethea. The north of the city is dominated by Mount Oleta which casts a shadow over Vidonia. The winged elves bastion rests upon Oleta’s peak. In the centre of the city is the council dome where the high council of elves meet. The eastern entrance of the dome opens onto the highway which is the Rock Road that runs through the city next to the River Tayce. The council travels this road alone when they go to the Rock of Ages to speak with Titan.<br />
<br />
Inluar, the council dome, has but one room. There is a stone circle which has ten seats within it, facing inwards. The room is divided into five sections, one for each alamia. Within the stone circle there are no sections but the seats reflect the nature of each alamia councillor. They call the stone circle, ëŁãé. The water elf seats are partly submerged in a pool, the winged elf seats have stone wings protruding from the back, the forest elf seats are entwined with vines, the ice elf seats are carved from ice, and the mountain elf seats are from rocks that seem to be a part of the stone circle itself.<br />
<br />
Each section within the room has benches/seats for the public, and again the environment reflects the alamia to which the section belongs. The Mountain Elf<a href="" title="Create page: Mountain+Elf"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> section has stone benches carved from a sloping rock; the Forest Elf<a href="" title="Create page: Forest+Elf"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> section is amongst trees with the roots and branches forming wooden benches on all levels from front to back; the Ice Elf<a href="" title="Create page: Ice+Elf"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> section has a floor of ice with benches carved from the glacier; the Water Elf<a href="" title="Create page: Water+Elf"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> section is a water and pool where the heads of the water elves emerge from the depths to listen to the meeting; the Winged Elf<a href="" title="Create page: Winged+Elf"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> section has lofts in the curved ceiling where they perch and swing, looking down upon proceedings.<br />
