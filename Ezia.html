<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
 Ezia's face is always veiled below the eyes. The veil matches her clothes which are silk, purple robes. She is swathed in this fine material to cover her entire body. Even her hair is hidden underneath her cowl and hood. Above the veil glows her purple eyes. Her face has never been seen.<br />
<br />
<b>Temples:</b><br />
<br />
Her temples are beautiful, restful, tranquil. A variety of fountains trickle ice cold water, there is no roof, and waterfalls are its walls. In the very centre, there is a still pond, not of water, but some other liquid, clear, but more of an entity then water could ever be. From this Ezia appears to those who seek her and pray to her, or she appears as a face in the shallows, and speaks with a distant, ethereal voice.<br />
<br />
<b>Powers:</b><br />
<br />
Ezia has powers like no other in the Nether Realm. Only the Master of Divination and Healing would be able to rival her. Healing is a lost art in this world and she is the last who knows all the ancient healings. She can cure anything but death, and some believe she can even cure that, but her powers are limited to reviving only one person, so the legend goes. It is not known if she has used that gift.<br />
<br />
She is not a typical Djinn, she is not interested in power, only healing those who seek her out, or giving cures to those who have journeyed on behalf of another, and teaching wizards the First Healings.<br />
<br />
<b>Extra Info:</b><br />
<br />
Ezia is worshiped by a group called the <a title="Healers of Ezia" href='Healers+of+Ezia.html' class='wiki'>Healers of Ezia</a>. They are very hard to find and it is believed that their numbers are dwindling.<br />
