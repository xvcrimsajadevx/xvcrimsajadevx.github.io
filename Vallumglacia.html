With fortresses dotted along the inside of the wall and outposts to supply the soldiers who guards the wall. The cities and towns built on the inside of the wall are mainly trading posts. These settlements are built into the wall and the living areas are caves and tunnels interlinking along the inside of the ice wall. These pretty ice caverns sparkle inside and the weak sun filters into them through tunnels that channel the light from the distant suns.<br />
<br />
The wall is a hundred feet high, and thousands of miles in circumference. It reaches the southern coast beyond <a title="Sephya" href='Sephya.html' class='wiki'>Sephya</a> and touches the mountains in the south that line the coast.<br />
