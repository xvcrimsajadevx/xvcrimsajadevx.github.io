At the peak of its glory much of the civilized world feared it, from humes to elves the slave traders were notorious for being a blight on anyone who travelled the sea's. With strong holds spread across the Nether Realm the trade had the advantage over the 'average' singular owner. They were known for their slaves and masters alike, the vampyres the dark elves and the necra the most notorious for buying slaves and supplying crew for the slavers. The price of an average slave depends on the particular trader, vampyres pay a premium for humes though. Today the trade's power in the world has fallen a bit and some traders have faded into the background due to stricter controls on the sea's from the Azail, merchants and hume kingdoms and water elves. Apollyon losing interest in his Necra has also had an effect on the Slave Trade worldwide.<br />
<br />
It's history is the same as anything of this kind, some pirates and smugglers saw a gap in the market and chose to exploit it. As long as there have been sailors there has been this despicable trade. The system functions in silence, only catering to the select few. Though they still hold much of the same power they once did with vampyres, and in the parts of the sea where their strongholds are, most of their work is done in secret or in the deep ocean and in hostile waters where help is unlikely. They have long lost their hold over the human society in Avalon, even Eraosia and Sedana have gained control over the trade and the sea faring traders have to drop their prices to sell to these humans buyers as their own kingdoms slavers provide cheaper and more ready slaves. Sea faring traders business as a whole is far from waning and is in fact on the rise again.<br />
<br />
The main hub of slavers is believed to be on the Isles de Mortis. This hub as a whole should be viewed as a completely separate entity in and of itself, it is still hailed as the home of this trade though for most slavers.<br />
<br />
The world wide trade caters to no one society or race but instead caters to any individual they view worthy and capable, they will sell to anyone and will take as slaves anyone and anything. They are completely amoral and malign. Though humans and other such creatures are often low on the pecking order there have been a human or two prominent captains that have been in charge of entire fleets. The majority of captains tend to be Necra and Dark Elves though, as vampyres do not like going forth on the sea.<br />
<br />
Most slave traders functions are hidden away, their buildings concealed by magic. The spells that cloak the place are strong and extra majick users are employed to ensure the strength of these barriers. In the rare case someone does manage to breech the walls of one of the buildings they are met with a less then warm welcome. An individual discovering slaver strongholds are either enslaved or disposed of.<br />
<br />
Majick is employed in capturing and the slavers of Sedana actively search out majick users to enslave for the production of Sedana's anti majick items.<br />
<br />
The trade itself is universal and consists of various ships and fleets, each with one purpose, but each individual and consisting of varied crews. The kinds of slaves any slaver wants may vary, some may take anything and anyone and some may be more specific and trade in elven slaves, majickal humes, dwarves...<br />

As there are many fleets and groups of traders members are free to use this article as a guide and create their own ship and individual group of slavers. The following are the current groups and can be used as examples of what is possible. Feel free to make a group that does not fit the norm and is more maverick or an anomaly.<br />
