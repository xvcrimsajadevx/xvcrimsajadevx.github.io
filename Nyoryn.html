Synopsis of Country/Region:<br />
<br />
Nyoryn is a simple country, with kind, simple people. There are no major cities. The leader dwells in various stately homes and manages the country as Baronies. Each region has a baron that reports to the Magnate. Many colonies of other races are within the borders of Nyoryn, land delegated to them as a gesture of goodwill.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_The_People_of_Nyoryn_b_'></a><h1><b>The People of Nyoryn:</b></h1>
<br />
The people of this country vary drastically, depending on their race, region and religion. There is nothing universal or absolute about Nyoryn. Its multicultural society breeds tolerance and acceptance though. It is very rare for someone to feel unwelcome or shunned as everybody is so different and there is much freedom of movement and trade and socialisation.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Geo_political_Infrastructure_b_'></a><h1><b>Geo-political Infrastructure:</b></h1>
<br />
Each Barony is run by its Baron (high noble) and they run the province like a state. The magnate is elected and can over-rule a Baron, especially if he is being tyrannical (which is rare).<br />
<br />
The Magnate Herok Landil oversees the running of the country.<br />
<br />
The Marshall Serg Seril runs the army, guards the borders.<br />
<br />
The Barons run each Barony, which are as follows:<br />
<br />
Gen : Ilii Rensa<br />
Shio : Paoli Tren<br />
Ramal : Saul Wendren<br />
Thenrosa : Yuki Owanya<br />
Brune : Ryn Edus<br />
Kali : Orphus Hyan<br />
Ophea : Cyndin Eda<br />
Undin : Lanwel Mazii<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Religion_and_Culture_b_'></a><h1><b>Religion and Culture:</b></h1>
<br />
Nyoryn has many cultures and religions. Many different kinds of religions thrive in Nyoryn due to its neutral status. Clans, tribes, the principalities, (<a title="Djinn" href='Djinn.html' class='wiki'>Djinn</a> Worshippers, Merchant Guilds, Menageries, nobles, all races live in harmony alongside one another. All cultures and religions are welcome and thus far everyone has co-existed in peace.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Laws_of_the_Land_b_'></a><h1><b>Laws of the Land:</b></h1>
<br />
The laws depend on the Barony. Peace is maintained by the Marshalls Guards though, and it is peaceful.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Trade_and_Currency_b_'></a><h1><b>Trade and Currency:</b></h1>
<br />
Trade is slow at the moment. Political disagreements with their neighbours along with the lack of ports means Nyoryn lacks trade and therefore many goods. It is a productive country though, with lots of land set aside for agriculture. Trade mainly takes place between the Baronies as different regions do tend t specialise in different products.<br />
