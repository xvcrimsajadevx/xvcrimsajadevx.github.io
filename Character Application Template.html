<a title="Building a character" href='Building+a+character.html' class='wiki'>Building a character</a> is the first step in any roleplay game, be it online post by post or tabletop dice. Characters can be created for a long list of different reasons. You may make a main character for a story, a minor supporting character or even an NPC character for filling in the holes. To help make things easier both for you and for the staff, we have provided a character profile application template for you to use when you do create your character.<br />
<br />
<ul><ul><li>All first time players MUST make a Main Character and use this template. If you do not use this template we will either edit your information into it or ask you to do it yourself.
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>New members cannot apply for a minor character before they have had a main character profile approved. For more information on main, minor and basic characters please read the <a title="Building a Character" href='Building+a+Character.html' class='wiki'>Building a Character</a> article.
</li></ul></ul>
<br />
<ul><ul><li>The fields of <a title="Allegiance, Alignment and Classes" href='Allegiance%2C+Alignment+and+Classes.html' class='wiki'>Allegiance, Alignment and Classes</a> are NOT mandatory, and may be left blank.
