The most proficient of Invokation Wizards and the Shaman are able to see the past, present and future by looking into a window they open using their invokation/shaman majicks, or they astral project themselves to that instant in time. Walking through time (otherwise known as time travelling) is reserved for only the most powerful of people, and thus far it is unknown if it has ever been achieved. Thus, we do not accept characters with this ability.<br />
<br />
Manipulating the time line comes via reaching through this window or using the astral self. Some majick users can cause their astral self to be seen by those in the other time frame, and effect events that way, but again this kind of spell must be cleared with staff before a plot is RPed. Other ways to manipulate time are by reaching into the river of time, seen through the window and touching the flow of time. Again, this must be done only when permission has been gained.<br />
<br />
We do not want major alterations in the timeline done often, but smaller alterations, or significant ones that involve the restoration of the timeline can be done with the permission of staff. Just remember to be clear how and when and who are effected. PM staff with details of the alterations you propose. This may sound restrictive but as you must know from reading/watching stories with time fluctuations it has to be exact and controlled otherwise things get confused and out of hand. When you start introducing paradoxes you have to keep it simple.<br />
<br />
Other time majicks include:<br />
<br />
Stopping/speeding up time (this is done by Shamans for the most part and the area effected is only within a certain radius of the shaman). Time slows or quickens within a few feet or sometimes an entire city, depending upon the spell casters strength. A smaller radius for this spell does not need permission in RPs but we suggest you ok it with fellow players before using it. A small radius would be a small campsite for instance (around twenty feet in diameter we would suggest be the limits on this.) As to how often this can be done, it depends on the strength of the individual. Shamans tend to be best at this spell and can on average perform it several time a day in short bursts. Other majick users are limited to around once a day, a few times a week and sometimes only once a week, month or year.<br />
<br />
Teleportation - as time and space are linked (the space/time continuum) teleportation is listed as a time majick. Some majick users have the Talent for teleportation (also listed as a mind majick) and can teleport short distances. For longer distances you need to gain permission. This spell can only be done once a day, even the Thyrza cannot do it more often then that, it is a very powerful ability.<br />
