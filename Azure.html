<a name='_b_Azure_b_'></a><h1><b>Azure</b></h1>
<br />
Azure is one of the four Origin powers that created the first races of The Nether Realm. Azure is the Origin of water, the Goddess if you will, of water and the creator of the Azail Race.<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Appearance_b_'></a><h1><b>Appearance</b></h1>
<br />
Azure is the crest of a wave, the whirling froth of the whirlpool, the currents and the depths of the oceans. She appears as a human form made and enshrouded in water, with fishes swirling around her. She can appear in any water form, even as an Azail, but most often she appears as a Siren. The Siren were made in her image, and sing the song of Azure, the song of the Seas...<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h1><b>History</b></h1>
<br />
Azure woke surrounded by nothingness, and filled with Light. She sensed her brother and sisters waking too and their powers as well as her own. Pondering her existence while she filled the first chasm with water, she tried to understand what is was she wanted from Creation. Covering the worlds in much needed water, breathing life into Titans creations, and giving Tempests the tears she so often wept, taking her tears into the great oceans the drops merging with her, becoming part of her, Tempests grief becoming her grief also.<br />
<br />
Yet why did Azure weep? Was it for the empty waters she had made. Beautiful as they were, carving rivers through Titans strong mountains, crashing against the cliffs, the edge of his domain, it was not enough. She felt as empty as the vast oceans of All the worlds...<br />
<br />
Deep underwater, in the darkest depths where Pyra's lights could not reach, Azure created life, the First of her races. the one's she called the Azail. She taught them the patience of the sea's, the wisdom of ages, and the love of all of Creation, the desire to see all the lands and the heavens, the love of Utinu and Tinu and the trapped Morwen... she gave them all the waters, the Gift of the Mother never to be forgotten.<br />
<br />
Death ravaged All Worlds and Azure was stricken with grief. Overwhelmed by Tempests tears Azure swelled and enveloped All Worlds, unable to withstand the torrent or control it she created the Kraken. the Kraken took the Azail and protected them from Azures Grief. Even though her children did not die, they were bound to the waters forever. This grieved Azure more then anything and she hid herself in the depths of All Worlds... until she was called by the Light Bearers.<br />
<br />
He made he promise, he enraged her and pleaded with her, and eventually he got his promise. She bound herself to the jewel he preferred to her. Invoking the Light within himself she saw the portion of his glory and bowed to it. She had forgotten her place amongst creation, in her grief she had forgotten her duty an an Origin. Returning the surface, but not to her people, she awaits the call of her Daughter, the Chosen One...<br />

<br />
Azure's powers can only be used by her races. Each spells strength depends upon the ability and knowledge of the caster. When the spells can be cast depends on whether or not the caster is close enough to a water source. To make water appear out of seemingly thin air is impossible. Only the most powerful casters can draw water from very far away or take it from the atmosphere or from deep underground. I.e one cannot cast Cascade if one is in the middle of a desert. How these spells are cast also varies depending on the race of the caster. An Azail may control water differently to a Water Elf, and visa versa.<br />
