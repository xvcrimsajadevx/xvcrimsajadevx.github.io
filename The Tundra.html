Between the enclosed villages and towns the are no plains or grasslands, only the Tundra. The snow nomads are the few humes are dare to inhabit these area's. Yeti's and other fell beasts own these lands but the nomads have tamed them somewhat and along with the Silvermyst kindred have made these vast lands their home. thousands of miles of Tundra exist, but few dare to travel across it, as in between the tundra's lye the dreaded Ice Wastes.<br />
