In Wizardry and Sorcery there are a list of recognised Talents. Some are specific to the School and some are independent of them (such as the elemental talents). Not all Wizards and Sorcerers have Talents and not all Talents require a great depth of ability in the Ether to wield. Talents normally reveal themselves at an early age and often dictate which school one would choose to specialise in. In many cases Wizards and Sorcerers seek out those with Talent and identify them as Ether uses by their Talents. There is often a struggle between the wizards and sorcerers for those who have these rare gifts.<br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: Talents are not exclusive to wizards and sorcerers but wizards and sorcerers do teach special spells to those with these talents that they would not otherwise learn. These are first and foremost Talents of the Ether, and no special training is required to have them, but training may be needed to control them.<br />

<a name='_b_General_Talents_b_'></a><h1><b>General Talents</b></h1>
<br />
These talents are often linked to certain schools and enhanced by certain schools.<br />
<br />
<b>Seership</b> (Invokation) - someone who has visions (of the past, present and future) without the need for time majicks. Time majicks are taught to help them control their powers, but their Talent enhances their powers of prophecy. Non Seers (Wizards of Invokation taught Time Majicks) can see the future (opening windows with the Ether) but Seers are more proficient and their visions clearer and more reliable, more accurate.<br />
<br />
Those who have no Ether ability are not called Seers, but soothsayers and have a very weak form of prophecy. So weak it is often referred to as fortune telling of vague futures, a shadow of the power of a Seer, an echo and a whisper.<br />
<br />
<i>Expansion on Seership</i> - The third eye (also known as the inner eye) is spoken of as the gate that leads within to inner realms and spaces of higher consciousness. The third eye is often associated with visions, clairvoyance, precognition, and out-of-body experiences. Wizards who have developed the capacity to use their third eyes are known as seers. Third Eye is an Invokation Spell only Seers can use. Only they can Invoke the Third Eye.<br />
<br />
<b>Empath</b> - &quot;to measure with the mind&quot;<br />
<br />
The Empath Talent is where a person has a feeling of expanded sensitivity or clairsentience. Clairsentience (a spell learnt by Empaths) is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person acquires psychic knowledge primarily by means of feeling. Generally the term refers to a person who can feel the vibration of other people, and see their aura's (see people's feelings). There are many different degrees of clairsentience ranging from the perception of diseases of other people to the thoughts or emotions of other people. A very vivid feeling can form.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Necroscope</b> - mainly Wizardry, some sorcerers. This is a Talent that allows someone to communicate with the dead. Unlike necromancers, who attempt to command the dead through rituals and spells a necroscope simply communicates with them without any physical interference.<br />
<br />
The term &quot;necroscope&quot; originally (in Greek) meant someone that can &quot;see&quot; (scope) into the dead (necro)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Greater Healing</b> (Divination and Healing)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Shape Shift</b> (Transformation)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Mind_Talents_b_'></a><h1><b>Mind Talents</b></h1>
<br />
These are Talents most closely linked to Mind Majick (also known as <a class="wiki"  href="http://www.thenetherrealm.com/wiki/Magus#_b_Psionics_b_.html">Psionics</a>). These are very powerful individuals and often unbalanced due to the force and stress on the mind. For this reason Wizards with these talents tend to use them sparingly, whereas sorcerers abuse these talents and use them all the time, often driving them insane. Rare Talents these are, and rare individuals who possess them.<br />
<br />
<b>Telepathy</b> (reading of minds)<br />
<b>Telekinesis</b> (moving of objects)<br />
<b>Teleportation</b> (transporting oneself)<br />
<b>Telepathic Hypnosis</b> (forcefully controlling the minds of others)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='_b_Elemental_Talents_b_'></a><h1><b>Elemental Talents</b></h1>
<br />
These Talents are often discouraged and even ignored as the fear of becoming Magi is so closely linked to them. Ether Ability only comes into play here when becoming Magi. Those weaker in Ether Ability are at a lower risk of becoming Magi.<br />
<br />
<b>Aeromancy</b> - air majick<br />
<br />
<b>Pyromancy</b> - fire majick<br />
<br />
<b>Hydromancy</b> - water majick<br />
<br />
<b>Geomancy</b> earth majick<br />
