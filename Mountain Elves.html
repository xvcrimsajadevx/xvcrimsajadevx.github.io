<a name='_b_Mountain_Elves_b_'></a><h1><b>Mountain Elves</b></h1>
<br />
<b>Region:</b> Mainly Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> and Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a><br />
<br />
<b>Appearance:</b><br />
<br />
Mountain elves are lithe and slender but tend to be taller then most other elves. They almost always have brown and black hair and tanned skins. They are the hardiest of elves and the most earthly of elves, in dress in magic and in looks. They tend to be the most noble of alamia, dressings as Lords and Ladies, a sense of duty which keeps their heads held high.<br />
<br />
Rarely a smile cracks a mountain elf's stern visage; their elongated, well defined and ageless faces cast a harsh judgement upon those they deem less worthy. They are a proud people and are often misunderstood even by their own race; their thin, hooked noses turned up in defiance against the world. Chiselled features do not at first lend to the female mountain elf's natural elven beauty; their tough and placid exterior often tempered by their high cheek bones, delicate chins and almond shaped eyes.<br />
<br />
Males mountain elves most often have thin faces that lead down to cleft chins, broad strong shoulders, long limbs and strong hands with long dexterous fingers. Mountain elf eyes are windows into the sharpness of thought behind this tough exterior. Their piercing looks rarely linger and make judgements very quickly, seeing the truth of all things more often then not. It is hard to lie to a mountain elf.<br />
<br />
They have a confident stride, their heads held high, their backs rigid, gliding along effortlessly with an air of authority and wisdom. Silk and velvet robes with simple designs cover their pale skins; these clothes though expensive and well made are often kept more simple compared to other elven clothes, even for the females. This in fact accentuates their stature as it is a common feature of nobility. Although considered the nobility of elves, they rarely wear excessive or tacky jewellery. The only jewellery that may be seen might be magic rings, or amulets, or family heirlooms, always very tasteful and simple in their design.<br />
<br />
<b>Personality:</b><br />
<br />
Calm, stoic, level headed elves, they are one with nature and meditate every day to strengthen their bond with the Earth. Brave and fierce warriors, the best stonemasons in the land they can adapt to any society and race. Normally very fluent in several languages, educated in other cultures of other races and alamia, the mountain elves are looked up to by other elves, and are identified as the most prominent as elves by other races. Sometimes a bit haughty, and with a tendency to look down upon other alamia. For this reason, not long after the Sundering the mountain elves established the first and most notable noble houses. They have a more stable hierarchy because of this, most other elf alamia simply honouring the Eldest Blood. Mountain elf nobles honour achievements and wealth, as well as the descendant's blood. This leads to not only these mountain elf nobles to look down upon elves of their own alamia, but also to be arrogant with other elves outside of their alamia.<br />
<br />
Pride in who they are, what they can do and what have have achieved drives the culture of mountain elves. It would be wise, if ever you met one, to not insult them in this way.<br />

<a name='_b_History_b_'></a><h3><b>History:</b></h3>
<br />
0E - The Making of the Elves<br />
<br />
- The Sundering of the Elves. Sub-races of elves were formed - these Alamia took on unique characteristics and traits depending on which part of nature they aligned themselves with. Some Alamia remain closer to <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> than others, such as the Mountain and Forest elves whilst other such as the Ice elves segregated themselves completely from Lenal<a href="" title="Create page: Lenal"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
1E-The <a title="Darkness" href='Darkness.html' class='wiki'>Darkness</a> curses the elves with the Fading; they are no longer truly immortal.<br />
<br />
10E- The Mountain Elves are drawn to <a title="Vesta" href='Vesta.html' class='wiki'>Vesta</a>, where they are taught the secrets of the Earth by <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. <a title="Vesta" href='Vesta.html' class='wiki'>Vesta</a> becomes their spiritual home, Mountain Elves being the only Alamia able to withstand her fires.<br />
<br />
156E- The Temple of Truths is built in honour of <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a>. It is the first of many great structures built with the <a title="majick" href='majick.html' class='wiki'>majick</a> of the Mountain Elves.<br />
<br />
243E- Yaenara is the second great structure to be built by the Mountain Elves, using their majicks. It is located in the Mountains of Avalon<a href="" title="Create page: Avalon"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, upon the only known Sanctuary on that continent. At the request of the Winged Elves it is built in secret and hidden using Earth majicks.<br />
<br />
531E - The High Council of Elves is formed. The first meeting was in the Alumi Grove<a href="" title="Create page: Alumi+Grove"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>.<br />
<br />
-Igradr Nasurlean and Ktailr Teateohe are chosen to travel to <a title="Vidonia" href='Vidonia.html' class='wiki'>Vidonia</a> to take their places on the Elven High Council as representatives of the Mountain Elves.<br />
<br />
570E - The Mountain Elves and Dwarves combine to build Nakra<a href="" title="Create page: Nakra"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a>, the Wasteland<a href="" title="Create page: Wasteland"  class="wiki wikinew">?</a> Fortress.<br />
<br />
1570- The <a title="Vallumglacia" href='Vallumglacia.html' class='wiki'>Vallumglacia</a> is built, the greatest work of the Mountain Elves thus far.<br />

<a name='_b_OTHER_b_'></a><h3><b>OTHER:</b></h3>
<br />
Mountain Elves are legendary stonemasons who built the great cities of the Nether Realm. They are the most adept at using the elves earth majicks and use it to enchant the rocks of the mountains to build the walls tall and strong. Never has a city or wall that was made by a mountain elf stone mason been breached or destroyed.<br />
<br />
Their High Blood is considered by most alamia as their nobility. These nobles are the oldest of elves, and the most sophisticated. The closest thing in elven society to Royalty, these elves are rich, often pompous and arrogant.<br />
<br />
This alamia are rated highly by others because they remained the closest to Titan out of all the other alamia. It is why their nobles are considered such, because they are the oldest, and their <a title="Titan" href='Titan.html' class='wiki'>Titan</a> magics are the most powerful an elf could produce.<br />
