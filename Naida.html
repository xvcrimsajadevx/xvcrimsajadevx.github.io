<br />
The major port city of Lenal, this harbour is inhabited by all and any alamia. Many humans also reside here and as a result there is a large part of the cities population who are half elven. A bustling city of trade and business, many elves barter here and board various boats bound for many destinations throughout the world.<br />
<br />
The harbour and docks are vast, stretching for miles along Lenals northern coastline. Huge ships - elven, Azaili, human - dock here and thousands of tons of cargo are offloaded and picked up each day. The city is flat and packed with taverns, inns, stables and markets. The residential area’s are mostly in the outskirts of the city and far from the docks.<br />
<br />
Naida has many visitors, most temporary, so the permanent residents tend to live in the hamlets and farms in the surrounding areas. The Rock Road, that starts in Naida and passes through Vidonia to the south, is the main highway out of town and is always very busy. River boats float upon the tributary rivers that often run alongside the Rock Road, all coming from, or going to the great elven harbour of Naida.<br />
<br />
A mile out to sea from the shores of Naida is a long abandoned Azaili outpost called Anâá. It is now inhabited by the water elves and is their main region near Lenal. Contact between the water elves of Anâá and the inhabitants of Naida remains constant; the water elves stop pirating vessels from entering Naida’s bay.<br />
